    "Who is Andrew Fox ?",

    "A singular songwriter and producer from New York City, Fox is a mercurial and versatile artist, whose stylistically diverse body of work represents his distinctly surreal, cinematic sensibility.",

    "After several releases on art-house electronic labels  as VISUALS (Nicolas Jaar's Other People, Bruno Pronsato's The Song Says), in 2019 Fox dropped the pseudonymous handle to release his 2019 LP Shock By Shock under his own name.  Taking cues from David Bowie's Young Americans and Shuggie Otis' classic Inspiration Information, Fox's 'debut' album is a 'psychedellic cross country road trip through the mind', appropriate for strange times and a wandering mind.",

    "After a stint writing new material in Mexico City, Andrew Fox returns to the music scene in 2020 with Only Now' - an uplifiting, cosmic fusion of his dancefloor days in Europe as VISUALS, and the widescreen production and songwriting flourish of Shock By Shock, released by Brooklyn based label House of Feelings.  Featuring a powerful baritone vocal and a soaring guitar lead, Only Now is a song about transcending existential loneliness through the healing power of music."
