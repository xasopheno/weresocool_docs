    "Molly Bolten is a musician, songwriter and audio engineer from Oakland, California. A musician since early childhood, she studied music composition and creative writing in college. Once described by a softboi on Tinder as a “neo-soul Fiona Apple,” her music invokes a wide variety of influences from Billie Holiday to Courtney Barnett. Expect to be pulled in and spit out by her songs, which are equal parts scathing and sweet. Molly also runs a multimedia web zine called QUARANZINE for art made during the pandemic; this keeps her somewhat sane."
