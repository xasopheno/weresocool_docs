    "bio": [
      "City Harvest helped start the food rescue movement in 1982 when a group of New Yorkers saw that New York City had an abundance of excess food even while a large number of its residents struggled to feed themselves and their families. We recognized the practical purpose that this surplus food could serve if directed to New Yorkers who needed it, filling the plates of the working mom who had trouble making ends meet at monthâ€™s end, the senior in the apartment upstairs living on a fixed income, or the family around the corner coping with a large and unexpected medical bill."
