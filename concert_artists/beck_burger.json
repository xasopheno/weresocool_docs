      "The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation, the non-profit organization that owns the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival presented by Shell, has established the Jazz & Heritage Music Relief Fund – a statewide relief fund to support  Louisiana musicians who have lost income amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  This unprecedented crisis has led to the indefinite cancellation of gigs, event postponements, and venue closures around the world. It has left many Louisiana musicians and others who work in the music industry facing a total or near-total loss of income for the foreseeable future.  "
