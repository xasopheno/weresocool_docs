    "'Take Two' weaves together the spaces, stories and songs that emerged for Maya during the first few months of the pandemic. In March of 2020, Maya moved from Brooklyn to Western MA. As she navigated both familiar and foreign spaces, in the world and within herself, Maya explored the ways that shifts in connection evolved to expose the richness of solitude, the sweetness of sisterhood, the pangs of separation, and the power of starting over.",

    "Maya LaLibert√© (she/they)* is a dance and visual artist, poet, teacher, and musician based in alliterative homes across the continental US; Brooklyn, the Berkshires, and Boulder**. As a performer and choreographer she is invested in the exploration of the voice, vulnerability, and power of the dancing body. Her work has been presented at the American Dance Festival, the Bates Dance Festival, the Boulder Jazz Dance Festival, Smith College, Triskelion Arts, as well as various venues throughout NYC. Maya's training spans many forms and disciplines, all of which inform her improvisation. Maya honors and thanks her teachers and fellow students.",

    "You can follow Maya on instagram to stay updated (albeit somewhat infrequently) on their upcoming performances and various projects: @maya.laliberte",

    "Maya is also gathering material to share in a monthly newsletter, which has yet to launch.
