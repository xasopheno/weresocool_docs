    "Jacquelyn West is a singer/ songwriter based in Brooklyn, New York. In 2008 she began writing and performing around the city. Her songs revolve around the sensation of perpetual longing and the playful sadness that one may feel living within ancient and ever-expanding time.",

    "Jacquelyn’s ventures with live music turned into a true passion for jazz and improvisation. She has spent the past few years leading jazz ensembles, performing the timeless tunes of The American Songbook.",

    "In March 2020, when the world came to a near instant halt, Jacquelyn began exploring her guitar again and found that songs just kept on flowing. She ran with it. With the help of some friends, Jacquelyn is now in the process of recording her first full length album.",

    "Currently, you can find her singing jazz standards at “The LoveLace” on 66 Pearl Street in Manhattan on Saturday’s and Sunday’s 1-4."
