    "Inner Movements is a collective founded by Crystal Pascucci and Mark Clifford celebrating the music of the 20th, 21st centuries and newly commissioned works. Realizing works of open instrumentation, Inner Movements aims to explore the sonorities exposed by the combination of strings and percussion. The aleatoric nature of percussion overtones combined with complex string instrument resonance supports ambiguity, reinforcement, and envelope contrast.",
    "Inner Movements is a highly flexible ensemble, with performances ranging from large groups to solo sets. Pascucci and Clifford both compose for the ensemble, and often perform as a duo. Their performances predominantly feature original compositions for vibraphone and cello that explore 20th and 21st century musical language, intersected with idiomatic free improvisation."
