      "To free ourselves me must feed ourselves! Since Soul Fire Farm  opened in 2010, we have primarily operated out of the living room of a single family farmhouse. While this was appropriate in the early years, we now have thousands of program participants attending courses each year in a makeshift campground scenario with an outdoor kitchen, porta potties, canvas tents, and bucket showers. The drinking water well, septic system, and family home are groaning under the impact of this excessive use."
