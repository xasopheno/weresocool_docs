Dugnad rec artist and maker of #DailyPiano videos on Facebook and Instagram. Born 1988 in Ålesund. Played in Åse Skolekorps Marching Band. Got a really great Swedish piano teacher at age 10, who encouraged to pursue all music, not just classical. Got heavily into early Elton John, soul, funk, fusion, jazz and avant-garde - still studying George Gershwin & Béla Bartók. Played in the local Big Odd Band, leading to The Middle Norwegian Youth Big Band (Midtnorsk ungdomsstorband), meeting future collaborators Henrik Munkeby Nørstebø, Kristoffer Eikrem and Dan Peter Sundland. Went to the Sund Folk College's jazz class (check that thing out!) and got to consistently playing piano with other people in bands for the first time. Started more long-term bands with Andreas Wildhagen, Followed these peers into the prestigious jazz conservatories of Scandinavia. Touring and releasing albums with Akmee, Lana Trio, Orter Eparg and Baker Hansen. Working in electronic music, clubbing and production with Bendik Baksaas, leading to the most recent collab with Stian Balducci (+plattform). Watch out for upcoming spring things.",

All their members offer a free of charge service to families with at least one pre-school child by providing support and friendship through regular home visiting. Last year world wide 20,000 Home-Start volunteers worked with 40,000 families. We got such kind help from our local Homestart here in Oslo, and I really appreciate their efforts to assist families like ours when we suddenly became parents to our blessed triplet girls Iben, Turid & Eivor.",
