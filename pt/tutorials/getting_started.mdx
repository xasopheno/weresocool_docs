> **<CoolText>WereSoCool</CoolText>** is a programming language for composing microtonal music. You might find this language useful if you want to make cool sounds and impress your friends/pets/plants.

## Try WereSoCool

You can download the **<CoolText>WereSoCool Application</CoolText>** which is a standalone editor. This is the coolest way to use WereSoCool and has some bells and even a few whistles. If you'd prefer to use your own editor, then you might enjoy the **<CoolText>WereSoCool CLI</CoolText>**. You can make some sounds in the browser with the **<CoolText>WereSoCool Playground</CoolText>**. WereSoCool is currently only single-threaded in the browser, so more complicated compositions will probably not render without clicks.

WereSoCool does not currently run on Windows. The underlying technologies are cross-platform, so it's certainly possible. I just don't have a machine to test it on. If you'd like to help get it running on Windows, please reach out.
