# Art Lande - Chet Baker

I was thinking of Chet Baker.  It was not that long before he died and he wasn’t well, but just the way that he would sit by me when I soloed and listen to my solo with the same intensity that he played.  No difference.  That it was the music and it was the piece and that he valued my contribution at such an essence level. 

Also, just how integrated he was.  You know, this thing about singing through your instrument.  That all through the evening, I couldn’t tell whether he was playing his trumpet or singing.  I play a lot with my eyes closed and I would think, “Oh, Chet’s singing now” and it would be the trumpet.  I was tricked every time.  It was amazing how completely he had made the trumpet his voice so that it sounded exactly like when he sang.  That was unbelievable to me.  Also, I could try to track his melodies – and he’s more or less a mainstream player – but so original, so intuitive in his playing.  You could never pigeonhole him.  I would think, “Oh, I know what he’s going to do here.  He’s going to hit a G.”  He would never hit the G.  I was wrong ever time and I loved being wrong every time.  It meant that I hadn’t played with him enough, but it also meant that he wasn’t just formulaic.  Then, when he would hit the “Ab” instead of the “G” I would say, “Oh, of course.  It’s a more alive note.  He’s going to play that!”   But I would be wrong most of the time and I can usually intuit these things.  I loved it, because it meant that he was completely in the moment.  Then, what he ended up doing would be way more eloquent than what you would think he would do.  That gave me tremendous respect for him as an improviser.  All that.  The whole thing. 

The humbleness of him and Kenny Wheeler, Lee Konitz, and Ron Miles.  These people are so humble.  It just breaks my heart in the best of ways.  To be recording with Kenny Wheeler and have him play this killer solo…this unbelievable solo… and to have him say, “Well, this take is probably ruined by a car horn or something, because this is the first thing I’ve played in this session that is worth anything and this probably won’t be usable.”  Then we listened to the take and we couldn’t use it for some reason and he said, “Told you!” 

These people that everybody admires and wishes they could play like and they just think they’re just so flawed that they don’t deserve to be playing at all.  They can’t imagine why anyone would want to listen to them.  Chet saying after the gig, “Why are the clapping?  I played so badly.”  Lee Konitz…same kind of thing.  How completely self-effacing they are.  It’s totally amazing to them that anyone would even want to play with them or listen to what they do.  These things are inspiring.  They help me.
