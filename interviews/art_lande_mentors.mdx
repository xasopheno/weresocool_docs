# Art Lande - Mentors

DM: Were there any important mentors that helped you form your ideas about life and music?

AL: Well, yeah…my mind just floods.  In the music area, I think of my Dad who was a kind of jazz piano player.  That wasn’t his profession when I was growing up, but he would play every Sunday for a couple of hours and I would lie on the couch and listen.  He would play all of the standards.  They went in me.  I kind of liked it.  I didn’t have to do anything…I would just lay there and listen and every once in a while, I could play a little bit with him.

Another man we called Uncle that wasn’t really an uncle, but a very close family friend.  He was also a pianist.  He hardly ever played, but he played such gorgeous chords.  He was the station manager of a radio station in New York and he would bring me records – Oscar Peterson, Errol Garner, Marian McPartland.  So, that was a lot of my education of hearing jazz was through the records he’d bring.  Then he’d sit at the piano and he played so different than my Dad – my Dad had this really bombastic style – and he played so gentle and so naturally.  He didn’t even know really what he was doing, but he a great ear and a beautiful touch somehow without much training.  I would just listen to him play.

Then, my classical teacher was Joe Conn who played with the NBC symphony.  He was a fantastic classical musician.  He was just a friend of the family – he lived down the block.  My Dad was kind of a hard guy, but Joe was so sweet and so nice.  A lesson with Joe, I mean, he had so much knowledge, but he was so generous with me.  I’m a bad student.  I didn’t practice enough.  I’m still bad at arpeggios because I don’t like practicing these hard things that aren’t fun…that aren’t so musical.  I’d hardly practice the arpeggios or this one piece that I didn’t like or was too hard and he’d say, “Oh, well it’s getting better.  You know, things take time.”  And I would feel like a moron.  Like, “I should practice more.  Joe is so nice and he should be telling me I’m full of it and instead he’s saying, ‘It’s ok.’”  It was just the opposite of my Dad who would yell at me.  That generosity was so great and it would inspire me to practice more.  He didn’t make me into some prodigy; he was more interested in how beautiful the melodies were or in bringing out different voices because they sounded nice.  [With him] I played a lot of Chopin and Bach and because he was so into the beauty of it, I could enjoy the music instead of it being about whether I was any good or not.  He would always say it was good even when I played bad.  So, that was a very good environment. 

Also, he was my friend.  I could go over to his house and sit around.  And when I got excited about jazz I could go over to his house and play him things that I like and he would say, “That’s great.  I never learned jazz like that” or “I really liked that piece.”  He was just so encouraging and good-hearted.  It was about the spirit of the music and not just about getting great. 

DM: Were there any other teachers – maybe as you got older – that were really helpful.

AL: There was actually a teacher before Joe.  He was a little bit of a hard-ass, but he was good, too.  His name was Morton Estrin.  After Joe, I didn’t study at all for a long time.  I took music in college, but it was more just classes about common practice harmony and stuff like that.  I didn’t take private lessons again until I was twenty-five.  From eighteen until twenty-five I didn’t take a lesson. 

Then, I was living in San Francisco and I was driving by the San Francisco Conservatory and not even knowing why, I pulled my car over and I parked and I went in and there was this class in progress.  [It was being taught by] this guy named Bill Mathieu, who later was called Allaudin Mathieu who was the arranger for Stan Kenton for years and subsequently a teacher at Mills College.  [He was] really a master of harmony and someone who could teach improvisation well and had a lot of knowledge about overtones and things I didn’t really know a lot about.  So, I walked into this class and people were doing this thing called, “News of the Week in Review.”  A person would play a piece and they had to play it about something they had experienced in life.  Like, “I had an argument with my Grandmother” or something like that and during the piece – the improvised piece - they had to say the sentence that told what it was very clearly.  They had to make a commitment to what the piece was about.  It was a fascinating class.  It was really great.  After the class ended, I meekly went up to him...maybe not totally meekly...because I was already playing with Joe Henderson and Woody Shaw and people like that.  But, something hit me about the way that this guy taught and his energy and I said, “I think I could learn something from you if you’d let me” and he said, “Sure, come on.”  Then I studied with him for six months every week.  I mostly learned about voice leading and harmony and overtones and these were really…they completely changed my playing and my perception of music as well as informed the way I teach as well.  [I remember] that when he told me about the overtone series, I got so angry.  It was like, “How could I be a musician for all of the years and nobody ever told me that?”  It’s like the birds and the bees of music.  It’s the science of what is sound.  I was so grateful to him for showing me that. 

I played for him the first lesson and he said, “Well, I’ll never be able to play jazz like you - you’re an amazing jazz player – but you’re only hearing about a quarter of the music you’re playing.  He said, “Play a chord” and I played a chord.   Then he said, “Just sing the second highest note.”  I couldn’t.  Then he said, “Just sing the bottom note.”  I couldn’t.  I could only sing the top one.  Then, he said, “Well, it’s amazing that you play what you’re playing, you don’t even hear it.  Also, you’re missing out on three-quarters of the music.”  And I said, “Wow, I want to hear more.  That sounds exciting.”  So, we worked on all these kind of ear training exercises and physical exercises.  I played five-part Bach fugues and I had to sing all the parts.  He helped me come more into the life…feeling my fingers on the keys and the shapes I was making and understanding the music intellectually and then relating it all to overtones.  It just made it more actual.  That was an explosion for me.  And after six months, he said, “Well, I could teach you counter-point, but you actually understand it perfectly without me giving you all the technical things.  I’ve shown you everything I know and you seem to get it, so have fun now.  Bye.”  So, that was my time with Allaudin. 

We’ve stayed really close friends and he comes when I play concerts near where he lives in Northern California and he kisses me after the sets and tells me how wonderful it is.  If I show him my chorals or something that came really out of his lessons, he just laughs and says, “These are all jokes.”  He said, “You trick our ears and then you make it seem like something is happening, but you’re making jokes.”  He was just playing through them and laughing the whole time and I thought that was really fun, because he basically opened up that world for me.  So I’d say he was the most important teacher I’ve ever had.

Then, there are all the players I’ve played with and continue to play with that have things to teach me.  The famous ones…Gary Peacock and Charlie Haden,Tom Rainey and Ralph Alessi…I’ve learned something from all of them.   Even the ones that are much younger than me, like you or Amy Shelly.  They teach me something whether it’s patience or simplicity.  [There are] all kinds of mentors.  Even when a person knows hardly anything, they might be more adept at something than you.  They have more insight into energy or wildness or low notes or something [laughs].  “Yeah, man…this person really plays some low notes.  So, these times of playing in bands, with great players, touring, or recording, you learn some things that you can take with you.  It’s a cast of thousands, actually.
