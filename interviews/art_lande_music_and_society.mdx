# Art Lande - Music and Society

DM: What are your feelings as to what we do as musicians - and in particular, as musicians who play art music – why that is something that is important to society?

AL: Well, I’m not sure that it’s important to society, actually.  I just think that it seems to serve a need – no matter how small – a specific need in some people to express their being in a really direct and poetic way.  People – for some of us, it’s important to have a potent and direct way to tell how life is…in action.  To enact who they are and what they’re sensing in a form…whether it’s painting or poetry…and the arts are a way of doing that.  [They] are languages that are… how can I say? - in some ways more specific and in some ways less specific than normal conversation.  So, we need a kind of non-verbal – and I think of poetry as being non-verbal just because we’re using language as sound and using language in sometimes non-linear ways.  Were we can just kind of tell the truth of our existence without having to tell it in linear language way.  And then we can have these discussions in these forms, like in music or in mixed media – mixed arts and we can commune in that way.  So, in that sense, for those of us who have that need and joy in doing that, it’s a way of us getting together.  And then for the people who are not participating directly in that language, for them to get a chance to be a part of that through witnessing it, whether it’s reading something or going to a performance or hearing a CD or whatever.  To participate in that discussion by allowing the things to play on their inner beings – emotional and some other parts of their being that aren’t purely intellectual or practical.  That’s what I think the other side is…the work or commercial world of things, where things are done.  You know, you do this and you get that.  But these things are not about that.  They’re more about, “What is it like to be alive?” and they’re not particularly goal-oriented.  They’re an exchange of energy in a kind of simpler state.  Kind of like animals – they’re physical and emotional…I don’t know…aesthetic or something…they’re not practical and their not “getting stuff done.”  That’s how I see it.  So, in that sense, it does fill a need, however again, I’m not sure it’s important, but it is essential somehow. 

DM: So then, largely what’s important in society – in the relationship between the arts and society - is the connections that people are allowed to make through the process.

AL: Exactly, the present time that you can enter of, “that makes me feel like that” and to acknowledge that.  If you’re doing it, you can say, “It makes me feel like that, therefore I make a loud sound.”  That you’re actually, in the moment, able to respond in very primal ways in the communal arts like that.  And in the private arts of painting and writing, then you can say, “I’m going to put more yellow onto this canvas – it makes me feel good when it drips and it looks like that – that’s what I feel like doing.”  Or when you look at it, you feel the freedom in the expression or the joy or the pain, whatever it is that you can connect with.  It’s more open ended.  It’s not what your supposed to do…you’re allowed to sense it in a more personal way than, “turn that cam-shaft so that the car will run.”  Which is very directly about getting a job done – you do this and that happens.  But when you throw the yellow paint, one person might feel joy and another person might feel disgust and another person might feel very little at all.  This open-endedness seems to be part of our essential humanity. 

DM: So, then how can we continue to develop the connections that we’re able to make in society?  I’m frustrated, because I’ve noticed that a lot of improvised music is still performed in bars and clubs and I think that is more representative of where we’ve been than where we are now.

AL: I agree with you, but that’s changing.  That’s not where I mostly play, for instance - even internationally.  I play at people’s homes, at little community centers, churches and rooms.  [In] New York, more and more, there are just rooms.  It’s just a room.  There is nothing in it.  It’s just a place where people can make things.  In Santa Fe, my friend, Bruce Dunlop has a place that is called, “Gig.”  It’s just a room.  [Also] realize that we don’t need alcohol and all of these distractions.  We don’t need commerce.  Just charge 10 or $5 or whatever people can pay. 

I’m doing a concert series at a church in Boulder with the Boy/Girl Band called “Deep Listening.”  People can come to the church and sit and feel things through music.  Just as they would go to meditate in a church for spiritual reasons. 

So, I think these things are changing.  It’s up to the artists and then the people who have spaces – all you need is a space, right?  People just need to start asking things like, “Hey, would you like to use your furniture store in the evenings for poetry.  It’s happening, actually.  It’s happening more and more.

So, the creativity has to not only be in the music or the poetry or the drama, but also in answering the questions, “How do we want to present this?”  And we can ask our friends and neighbors, “Hey, would it be fun for you to sponsor this or let us use your space?  Then, people can see your store.  You can have the fun thing of having music in your store or your house or your garage.  Many kinds of spaces are being used like that.  It’s moved away from being about getting away from something – going to the bar and getting drunk.  Instead of it being a relief from normal life, it can function now more like a retreat like we do for mediation or spiritual awakening or joining.  I think of all these as kind of churches.  Places where stuff can happen and people can commune together in these very simple ways.  They’re not doctrinaire, which is what I like about it.  I mean, hopefully their not – I guess they are sometimes, but because it’s not about language and its so open how its interpreted, if you just make noises or play music or just say words or do movements, its not trying to convince someone, “don’t believe in this” or "believe in that."  It’s a lot more open ended.
