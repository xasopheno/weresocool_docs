# The Great Bassists and Drummers

DM: Is there anything you would like to say about your time playing with some of the better-known players?  Maybe what you learned from playing with that kind of player.

AL: Well, the bass players, for instance.  I was thinking of both Charlie [Haden] and Gary [Peacock].  Although I’m not saying that those were the most successful collaborations.  As far as successful collaborations go, I think of Bill Douglas in San Francisco, Johannes Weidenmueller, and Dwight Kilian who I played with a lot longer and went a lot deeper and further with.  But, just the sense with those bassists that they were the “Lords of the Underworld” and that I had no idea what notes that they were ever going to play or even what beats they might play on – Kent McLagan is another one.  So, it really forced me to be collaborative.  It wasn’t good enough for me to know the song or read the chart.  I had to actually be present to deal with what they were making.  I had to be totally on it, listening, paying attention, being smart, and leaving space.  “Ok, he did that, what am I going to do?  I have no idea, so I’m just going to be silent.  Now, I’m just going to hold this note and see what happens.”  They forced me into present time of listening and working with what they put out there because they were so inventive…so courageous about their choices.  So, that was really inspiring.

The drummers…Tom Rainey, Eddie Marshall, Alan Hall, and Zakir Hussain…Some of these people are so adept with rhythm, so really they can play anything against anything – Tony Moreno is another one.  So, if they are taking eight bars or something and I don’t pay amazing attention and really keep track of what’s going on, I have absolutely no clue of where I am.  [It’s surprising] how easy it is to get thrown because they’re so amazing at playing what they play and keeping form.  I have to be completely focused and if not, in one second I’m completely lost. 

Eddie Marshall was so kind to me when I was young.  He’d play sixteen bars and I’d come in on the wrong beat and then afterwards, I’d say, “Eddie, how do you put up with me” and he’d say, “You’re doing great.  Everything sounds great.  Don’t worry about it” Again, that kindness…when I knew that I was barely hanging on for dear life to play with this guy. 

I remember having a rehearsal here at my house with Tom Rainey and in the middle of his solo realizing I had no clue and then coming in and him getting kind of mad.  I realized that if I’m going to play during his solo, I better play my entrance correctly because he’s building this whole thing based on the fact that I’m going to play my kicks in the right places.  So, either I lay out and just admit that I have no chance or I really do it well.  He’s building his house upon that foundation.  He’s so skilled and also so dynamically and emotionally involved in what he’s playing that if I come in on the “and of one” instead of “one” that the whole solo makes no sense.  It doesn’t work.  


Or Barr Phillips…wow.  Doing a whole tour of improvised music with him and how challenging it was to play with him, because he doesn’t play like a bass player.  He doesn’t hold any tones.  He plays melodies the whole time.  “Well, how do I play with that?”  To spend those weeks trying to figure out how to intersect with that and work with that…this kind of earthquake that’s going down below you.  Dave Holland is similar.  These bassists that play a lot of motion...Paul Warburton.  How do I stabilize in the face of this fantastic musician who’s doing something I’m not used to?  How do I find balance while playing with this person?  You just have to be present and keep sensing how to make it work.   They’re such forces and they have such a clear way of playing.  They’re kind of uncompromising…it’s just the way they play.  I want to be able to make music with them, but I can’t run my old stuff.  I have to find what really works with that. 

And while I’m doing that process, Barr is staying at my house and then one morning, he takes Otis [Art’s son].  Otis is one or two-years old at the time.  We wake up in the morning and Otis is gone with Barr and there’s a note from Barr saying, “I took Otis out for an adventure,” and he’s gone all day.  I thought that was incredible.  He comes home and says he says, “We had a great time.”  Otis was smiling.  It was amazing that he had made that bond with my son.  And then Otis ends up becoming a bass player.  Maybe it’s because of that day.  Who knows?
