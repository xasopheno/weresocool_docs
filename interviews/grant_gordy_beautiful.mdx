title: Grant Gordy - Three Beautiful Things 
---

DM: Can you talk three beautiful things you’ve been listen to?

GG: Ray Charles. There’s a recording of the song that he does called "A Fool for You" and there’s a studio recording of the same song.

The live version is maybe 10 or 15 clicks slower and it’s like walking through molasses and it swings so hard, it’s unbelievable how they make it happen. Whenever I want to hear some good soulful music, I go back to that recording. It’s astonishing because the band is so tight; and yet so loose, it’s alive, it’s all in concert. He’s got the most soulful voice and every little piano fill he plays is just perfect, all the perfect licks and all the harmony moves beautifully. It’s just one of the most beautiful things. Yeah.

Andy Statman came out with a new record this year. Andy is a mandolinist and clarinet player, who lives in Brooklyn. He came out of the bluegrass world, but he’s from New York City. I think he has a lot of different influences and he’s I think one of the most fascinating musicians in the American folk music scene.

GG: He’s really into Klezmer music and he’s a wonderful clarinet player. He’s also a deep improviser and is clearly really into free music. It’s funny because he got this weird combination of being a bluegrass guy and he’s good at playing old time, but again he’s from New York. He’s also really free, amazingly free player and he’ll be playing a mandolin which have two of each string and he’ll just de-tune one of his strings, so he gets this weird kind of out of tune thing. He’ll just play it like that and that’s what he’s doing.

The first tune on the record Old Brooklyn. It’s like on one chord. It’s an old-time tune. There’s a fiddle solo and it’s in the inside and the melody is really inside and it’s like a clawhammer banjo solo and it’s really inside; all of sudden, he comes in with his mandolin solo. It starts out somewhat diatonic and then it’s just go so out; he floats over the time.

He plays stuff that it doesn’t matter if it fits in the grid, it’s just what he’s playing; he’s playing really freely. He plays stuff that a typical bluegrass mandolin player would never play.

DM: Best mandolin solo ever.

GG: It’s just about the best mandolin solo I think ever on record as far as I’m concerned. It’s just beautiful, so expressive. He clearly has no interest in following convention. He’s just playing. It’s just astonishing. It’s the greatest solo and then they play the melody; all of a sudden, it vamps on this thing with, like, an electric slide guitar, then drums come in and it’s in 7 time signature. Only that guy would think of doing that, taking the old-time tune and all of a sudden, turns a corner into another dimension.

I think he’s just such a brilliant guy- whatever it is that he does, it just appeals to me so much. He is such an expressive musician. He just tears into the solo, it’s just so phenomenal. It’s unlike anything anybody else would ever play. I can’t think of any other man out there that would even think to try to take a solo like that.

I’ve also been listening to the Debussy quartet. He only wrote one quartet; string quartet that is. A lot of time people, because it’s often paired on recordings I think it’s from the same time period as the Ravel quartet, people will often equate them or almost take them as kind of synonymous; they’re both great.

The Debussy quartet particularly, I think is just wonderful. It was a big lesson for me harmonically, getting into that and learning how he’ll—it’s just my own interpretation of this. There may be a section where he’ll take one melody note and then you think the harmony is going to do a certain thing based on where it’s already down and where the melody is. He’ll take that melody note and pivot it, so that it becomes a different chord tone of a completely different chord.

It’s just kind of taught me that about harmony and that harmony doesn’t have to move in expected ways. It’s just beautiful, there’s some really beautiful melody and it’s just some of the most moving music. I’ve been listening to it for, I don’t know, I think seven or eight years now. I feel like every time I hear that I find something that I can come back to.

Particularly, the third movement is the most dramatic and just lovely thing. The way he sets up dynamic movement. Yeah. It’s just amazing. It’s one of the most beautiful things.
