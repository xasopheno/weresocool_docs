# Art Lande - Balance

DM: Can we talk about finding balance as a musician – being a whole person.  Being a musician that really connects with all of the aspects of their life.  I think a lot of musicians have a trouble with that.

AL: I think it’s important to remember that music is not about music – that it’s about life.  It’s an expression.  It’s a form.  It’s just like a language like Portuguese is a language to talk about life.  Music is just a language to talk about life.   Of course, just as somebody has to learn vocabulary and how to be understood in their language, there are elements of practicing and of learning enough tools in order to be able to communicate.  But then, the other part is to remember why you’re learning those things, which is to talk about the life you are living.  Therefore, you must live.  Connect with nature, connect with beings, connect with yourself, connect with the physical, emotional, spiritual, and the intellectual.  If you read a book on philosophy and then play a piece, it’s different than if you haven’t read the book.  If you go and hang out by a pond and then play a piece, it’s in there.  So, when you get so insular about your art form that everything is self-referencing, then you’re out of touch somehow.   In terms of connecting with other people, you should remember that most people don’t know much about music.  So, you can’t play music about music.  They could care less if you play a minor chord or a diminished scale; that has no meaning to them.   If you play the minor chord because of some somber sense of the universe and they feel the somber sense of the universe, they don’t have to know that you’ve used a minor chord.  They can just hear that sound from your life experience that’s in common with theirs. 

This also applies to the relationships musicians have with each other.  What we know and what we don’t know divides us.  Instead of integrating us, it can separate us.  That fact that somebody knows how to do cool things with their dominant chords and someone doesn’t – you should be able to play together.  A lot of times, people don’t do that because it’s all about that instead of, “you touched that note because you’re trying to bring tension.”  It’s simpler.  It’s not about all of the technique.  Somebody might know forty ways to talk about tension and another person might know ten, but that doesn’t matter so much.  When it does matter, it’s a problem.  Just like the listener , if the players are only playing about music, they feel “I can’t hang with that.”  It’s set up to be divisive.  It’s set up in a way that says, “this is a certain thing and only certain people that are in to this can get anything out of it.”  I think it should be rooted in simpler principals.  We should be asking, “Why do you play this slow thing?  Why do you play the dissonant note”  “Why do you play that kind of exciting rhythm.”  It might be in 15/8.  I might not even know how many beats there are, or maybe I do, but it’s not the point.  We can make beats that are erratic if we are talking about the erratic nature of life as it’s lived. 

 It’s about realizing when technique or knowledge is used for itself or it’s used to communicate something that’s more universal.  It matters most that you’re making something together in a band and that they’re trying to work with your language.  Even there, you can have a lot of different so-called levels or kinds of understanding that can exist in even the same group as long as technique is not the point. 

I also think that some of these art forms are divisive in a way that is just talking about style.  Instead of people worrying about whether it’s folk music or rock music, or reggae, or jazz, or something like that, we can go beyond the style thing as being the most important thing and just be more direct.  It’s important to be able to jump over the idea of style things and to really feel what is actually happening.  I think that sometimes, whether it’s because of insecurity or people – as you’re saying – not being balanced enough to integrate it with the entirety of their life, it becomes out-of-proportion.  The important thing becomes the genre or the specific knowledge that’s needed – to be in the "in" club.  Then there’s an "out" club.  To me, the art that really speaks is not made of that and it’s available for everyone. 

Personally, [when I’m in the audience] I try to go into everything as though it’s there and it’s my opportunity to connect with it.  I try to leave my prejudices at home.  Instead of asking how one piece is better or worse or more refined or more important than another, I just try to enjoy how yellow looks or crookedness feels.
