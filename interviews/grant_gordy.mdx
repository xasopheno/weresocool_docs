Danny Meyer: How long have you been in Colorado?

Grant Gordy: Just about ten years, I think it is.

DM: Ten years, wow. Can you talk about your time here?

GG: Yeah. I found that there’s really—it’s a little bit in insular here, in a way that I think is really wonderful because it maintains, supports a healthy sense of community. As you know, my main scene that I came up in was the bluegrass world. Here in Colorado, we have Rocky Grass Festival and Telluride Festival and there’s such a culture around that kind of stuff. There’s just a lot of support in the community both in the local level and for people coming through.

Also, it really feeds into a vibrant community. When I first came to Colorado, I lived in Fort Collins and I still feel like it’s almost kind of like a second hometown for me because it’s a wonderful town. There’s a wonderful community there and it’s a place where there’s a connection. Certainly, with the bluegrass thing, there’s a connection there. A lot of people are involved in that scene and thrive in it. I found that’s a thing that makes Colorado really special for me. It’s just a great community here.

DM: Yeah.

GG: Yeah. It’s also just really beautiful; naturally really, really beautiful. I was never into skiing or anything, but there are all kinds of wonderful outdoor things that you can do here. The thing that always appeals to me and really connected to me was the people here, and how they really foster that sense of community. Yeah, just on all different levels.

DM: You're a representative of a new breed of musician that is working in both the jazz and bluegrass communities. What is something you learned playing bluegrass that you may not have had access to had you only been in the jazz world.

GG: I remember the first time I went to the Boulder Outlook Jazz Jam. I remembered feeling that it was kind of a different thing because it’s all up on stage, you got to sign up on the list to play; it’s like a recital, like a concert kind of thing.

At a bluegrass jam, it’s just a bunch of people all hanging out in a place, maybe drinking beer or whatever. Just hanging out, play fiddle tunes, somebody sings and somebody throws in some harmony vocals and there’s not a pressure to be—you’re not trying to cut anybody. Nobody’s there to judge about what kind of changes you can play over. Not that I really feel a great degree of that in a jazz jam, but it’s certainly not about that in the bluegrass world.

It’s funny because bluegrass music, particularly, is a really virtuosic style of music; it’s very technically and physically demanding. It doesn’t have the kind of harmonic demand that I think you find in jazz, but it’s really virtuosic music. Great bluegrass players are just great musicians, but there’s a degree of acceptance. I mean if you can find an exception to everything but the degree of acceptance that happens in that world that is very comfortable to come up in. You go to jam sessions, the general feeling is everybody is kind of there to play and have fun. You don’t really have much to prove, so that’s part of it.

The other thing is that the whole oral of tradition is really, really strong in folk music; in fact, it’s predominant, obviously. Maybe it’s a little different with young people now with YouTube and stuff. But I think generally, if you grew up playing bluegrass, you’ll learn tunes through hanging out with people. Maybe it’s an overly romanticized version, but I always like to think that Charlie Parker probably did that too, just hanging out and playing. That he would learn that way.

Just yesterday, I hung out with a fiddle player and we sat down, he taught me a tune. He would just go phrase by phrase and that’s the norm. You don’t sit down with a Real Book. But it’s similar in the sense that there’s a standard repertoire that most people know. When you go to a bluegrass jam and probably everybody already knows "Red Haired Boy", "Blackberry Blossom", or "St. Anne’s Reel" or something.  

[In bluegrass] the “aural tradition” thing is very, very strong. And it is great for ear training. It tends to—I was going to say it gets you off the page, but it doesn’t even include the page in the first place. What I found for me is that it really strengthen my ability to listen on the fly and no matter what kind of music I’m playing, really be responsive and really use my ears and have that be my guide predominantly. Yeah, that was really healthy for me.

DM: What is something that you learned being a jazz musician that if you had only lived in the world of bluegrass; you never would have connected with.

GG: Yeah.  A lot of things, man. Personally, just different sounds that exist. There are instruments that happen that are motivated by breath; that doesn’t happen in bluegrass. For instance, the phrasing that happens with bluegrass, you can play literally an entire solo of constant 8th notes without ever stopping. You can play through four choruses of "Blackberry Blossom" or something, just play 8th notes and never stop because you don’t have to stop to breathe.

What I realized with the phrasing with jazz, it’s not just about being elusive, playing syncopated rhythmic stuff. It’s not about obscuring the beat, it’s just the things developed a certain way because people need to breathe - at least that’s certainly part of it. It’s part of how—I imagine how all the wind instruments developed that language and also, being syncopated and stuff was a big thing; just phrasing that’s really a big thing.

Also, being able to hear different kinds of sounds in my mind, imagining how piano player might phrase a line in my head rather than just thinking about how Tony Rice or David Grisman would phrase a line.

Of course, there’s also the harmonic thing.

A bridge for me- for a lot of bluegrass musicians - between one, four, five harmony that you find in a lot of folk music and then a complex harmony is swing music like Django Reinhardt.

Also, the Django thing is a sensible connection because technically, the style of playing Django relates more easily to bluegrass than playing like Miles Davis relates to bluegrass in the sense that it’s string music. It’s all played on strings, the Hot Club quintet was three guitars, and bass and violin, which isn’t really that far from a bluegrass band.

What I found for me, I was interested and started listening to Miles, Charlie Parker, some more modern stuff. I realized there’s a whole other thing harmonically happening there that I wanted to check out. Harmony has always been a really big thing for me. There’s always so much harmony in a lot of the music that I really love and if I hadn’t taken the time to really listen to Red Garland, Keith Jarrett, Brad Mehldau or Kurt Rosenwinkel, I would be missing out on this great wealth of harmonic information in approaches to harmony, in approaches to melody and rhythm that is really not in bluegrass. If it does, there’s a select few people that are doing it. It’s not really the standard part of the vocabulary with that music.

There’s a lot of things about getting into jazz that were really helpful and informative for me.
