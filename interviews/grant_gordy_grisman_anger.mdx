DM: Can you talk about some about David Grisman? What’s great about playing with him?

GG: David is a big hero of mine. Talk about kind of the bridge between diatonic harmony and progressive stuff, and getting into jazz. Even more than Django, he was really the bridge for me. He was into all these other kinds of harmony, writing these cool tunes that were really unique and with more sophisticated arrangements that you would find in a fiddle tune.

For me personally, he’s such a hero and such a legend. Also, he’s been around for a long time. He has lot of experience in the music business, toured with Stephane Grappelli, knew all the first generation bluegrass guys. He also got to play with Chick Corea and Niels Henning Orsted Pedersen. Jerry Garcia. He has had a very a illustrious career and he’s really steeped in the music business. I really respect him a lot and really appreciate that I had the opportunity to hang with somebody that a little bit more from the old school. I mean he’s quite a bit older than me. It’s the opportunity to get to hang with somebody that has seen into the past.

DM: And as a player?

GG: As a player, he has a gravity that is pretty much unlike anybody I have really played with; he has had such a singular voice for such a long time. I literally could tell his playing after one note. He had such a strong musical voice and style, but he doesn’t really rest on his laurels either. I find that there are times when we might be playing and he might go into sort of a free section or slightly more open section in the tune. All of sudden, he’ll do something that is really surprising like some harmonic superimposition that I was totally out of left field. Something I would never expect him to do.

He talks about—he loves Bill Monroe and he knows everything about old time music and Django Reinhardt, but one of his favorite musicians is Eric Dolphy. He’s got such big ears and he has heard so much. He just listens to so much, he has played with so many great musicians and he has a wonderful combination of having such a strong personal voice and style. He can make it work playing straight ahead bluegrass. He can play in a jazz group and do his thing, play the right notes. He has such a strong voice that’s really taught me a lot about just really being emphatic with what I’m going to play. If I’m playing something just really say it. To make a strong statement. Not to be afraid to put it out there.

GG: Yeah. I get to play with him in a week. I’m really excited because he’s another big hero of mine and he was the original violinist in the David Grisman quintet back when it started in 1978. He’s a legendary figure in the world of modern fiddle playing. I’m not a fiddler, but I know he’s had a very strong influence on everybody that came after him in terms of what is stylistically possible on the fiddle. He's always absorbed a wide variety of influences; for instance he’s one of the people responsible for bringing awareness of Swedish music to the States which has become a tributary that fed a little bit into what people are checking out now in acoustic, folk music. People are learning Swedish tunes.

He’s really responsible for bringing some jazz into the vocabulary of what fiddle players can do. His first record, he recorded "Moose The Mooche". He’s a wonderful guy too, such a joyous player. He’s one of those guys that’s always into playing. I remember one time he played a gig at Swallow Hill. He'd just finished playing the show and we talked for a moment, but very soon thereafter we just headed into another room to play some tunes together.

He seems to always want to play and he’s just great. He’s one of those really ferocious musical minds that is a real inspiration and clearly he’s been that way his whole life. He’s involved in the American Roots Music Program at Berkeley now. He’s able to influence more and more young people in that setting, which is just great because he’s one of those guys that’s a national treasure, I think. He’s a great bluegrass fiddler. He’s one of those guys that totally took it to the next level in terms of improvisational ability and composing chops, just really heavy guy.
