# Moving To New York

DM: You’re moving to New York in January.

GG: Yes.

GG: You’re moving there, too.

DM: Yes I am. In February.  Are you playing any shows before you go?

GG: I decided that it would be nice to do some kind of farewell Colorado concert. I’ve been here for almost ten years. It just seem like it would be nice to do a send-off thing, so I put together some Grant Gordy quartet concert. One of them is going to be at the Swallow Hill, where I played a few times here in Denver, one at the Black Rose down in Colorado Springs, one at Avogadro’s number in Fort Collins. It’s with my own band and often this happens with a lot of things, I just have to figure out a lineup, you can’t be always the same people every time.

I thought it would be fun to hire Matt Flinner, he is a really great mandolin player and Billy Contreras, who’s this legendary violinist, heavy jazz musician guy from Nashville. Both of whom I’ve never really worked with or certainly haven’t worked with him in this context, so it will be completely new endeavor, but I think it would be fun. I think it’s going to be a great band. Ian Hutchison, who plays with my quartet usually will be the bass. Yes, it should be very interesting.  I have no idea what it’s going to be like, but I’m excited. I think it’s going to be good.
