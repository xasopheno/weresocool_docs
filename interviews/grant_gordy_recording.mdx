# Grant Gordy - Recording

DM: You put out a record recently. A really, really great record.

[This is really one of my favorite records. Beautiful songs. Incredible improvising. Grant has been nice enough to allow me to post here a track from the record as well as a chart for the tune. Here

GG: Yes and thank you.

DM: Yeah. You played with some incredible musicians on that record, can you talk about those guys.

GG: Yeah. Well, David Grisman plays on one tune and of course he’s great.  

Dominick Leslie is the mandolin player, who plays on most of it and he’s from Evergreen, Colorado. I met him when he was probably 15, he was really young. I was able to—I was lucky because I met him when he was still in high school and he wasn’t doing that much. I’d coerce him to come over to my house and just learn my tunes before he had a gig or anything. It’s great and we were able to really spend a lot of hours playing together. I think we just forged a good musical bond and he’s one of the real happening young mandolin players in the world now. He now lives in Boston and tours with a bunch of people and just working like crazy, he’s great.

The bassist is a guy named Paul Kowert, who studied at Curtis in Philadelphia and is currently the bassist in the band Punch Brothers and is enjoying a lot of success and tours all over the world. I think they might even be in Europe right now. He’s just one of the leading guys in the acoustic bass world right now. His arco chops are incredible.

It’s hard to talk about Paul and not bring up Edgar Meyer because Edgar was the guy who started the thing of virtuosic folk arco playing that’s classically informed Paul is carrying the torch of that thing. Also, he’s a solid jazz bass player and he studied with the great Richard Davis. Paul’s just a great player.

Alex Hargreaves is one of the most happening young violinists. I believe he is 20 or 21 now. He plays on the record.

DM: He sounds so great.

GG: Yeah. He’s amazing. He started really young. He was great when he started and just gets better all the time. He’s one of those guys who’s a great fiddler and can play like Mark O’Connor or Stuart Duncan- he can play bluegrass and everything, but has really absorbed modern jazz in a significant way, and there aren’t a lot of fiddlers who have done that. He can play Wayne Shorter tunes as well as he can play bluegrass fiddle tunes. He really knows what he’s doing. He’s just great, really amazing player.

Jayme Stone is a dear friend of mine and a fantastic banjo player who lives here in Boulder, who played banjo on a couple of songs and co-produced the record with me as well.

Jayme is a tremendously diverse and accomplished banjo player, the likes of which is pretty rare. I’ve been able to work with him a lot over the years, mostly doing projects that he devised. One project that he did was he traveled to Mali and learned about West African music and then connected with a Malian griot musician. We went and made a record of all these African tunes and he just really dove into that stuff.

Right now, he’s working on this project and transcribing a bunch of Alan Lomax recordings and he’s really into that.  He’s the furthest thing from a straight ahead bluegrass banjo player that you're going to find because he’s always assimilating different kinds of stuff. He was listening to Kurt Rosenwinkel and Keith Jarrett when he first picked up the banjo, which is a pretty rare thing.

He’s one of the most totally diverse and just really hungry banjo players out there.

DM: Yeah. First time we hang out, we sat and listened to Footprints Live - Wayne Shorter.

GG: Really? Makes sense. Last time I saw him, he played me this Sibelius concerto that he’s been totally obsessed with.

DM: Sibelius 2.

GG: And then, he played me this string quartet arrangement of one of his tunes that he’s doing, then we sat down and played the Tennessee Waltz. He’s totally amazing.

He’s also just one of the hardest, if not, the hardest working musicians I know. I don’t even know what to say. He’s such a hard worker. It’s amazing. Does a lot of, most if not all, his own booking, and tours all over the country and all over the world.
