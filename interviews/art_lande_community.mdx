Art Lande - Community

DM: I think that something that you are particularly good about is creating a space for community and I think a lot of that has to do with what you just said about everyone being allowed to play.

AL: Yeah.  It’s an invitation.  This is really essential.  The arts – or whatever it can be…basketball…it can be everything – are in invitation rather than a challenge. Its not about asking, “can you deal with this.”  To come to a concert and say, “Well, if you’re hip enough, you can enjoy my music.”  Who needs that?  It’s more to say, “I welcome you into this realm and I invite you to have your experience with it.  It’s about welcoming rather than intimidation.

DM: Could you talk about the way that you think about being a teacher?  I think you’re a great teacher and you have helped a lot of people become better people and musicians, myself included.  So, how do you approach teaching.

AL: Well, it’s very similar in the sense that the impetus needs to come from the person who wants to learn or be exposed to something.  So, I never advertise my teaching or try to get people to learn from me.  It has to come from the person saying, “I would like to learn about this, are you willing to help me with this?” or “Please help introduce me to this world? or “Help me along on my path?”  So, pretty much every lesson, I ask, “What would you like to do today?" or “What would be helpful for you?”  I think these kinds of questions are important.  “What are you interested in?  What are you curious about?  What are you excited about?  What do you want to go deeper into?  What are you ignorant about that maybe I can help you to discover?"  So, it’s definitely centered on the person who wants to learn and not on the teacher.  I’m not sure every teacher works like that.  A lot of them teach their things that they want to teach.  I think it’s really important that the student is the one who feels the energy and sets the topics and it’s the job of the teacher to keep checking in and asking, “Is this what you want to be doing?”  I think it’s important to honor the wisdom in the person. 

 The other main thing is that I don’t have knowledge, or secrets, or something special that you don’t have.  You actually have them.  We’re born musical somehow.  We’re born with all the knowledge.  It’s just about learning to make an environment where it can be accessed and that we do it together.  So, it’s not, “I know this and you don’t.”  That’s not accurate.  I might have a little more experience in something or remember my connection to that a little easier than you.  So then to create an environment so that you can come into that – you can be invited in – so you can see it and you can experience it.  That’s my job. 

 We can both be excited about what we can discover.  I need to learn in the lesson, too.  I don’t just spout my things.  It’s more like, “Let’s find out something about long notes, or playing fast” Finally, we forget who’s the teacher and who’s the student.  It’s more that we participate in something together.  That’s to me the essence of the relationship.  It needs to be alive for both people.

 It’s an inquiry.  I think that’s a key in performing, teaching…actually anything.  It’s not an answer.  When there’s an answer, then there is right and wrong.  When it’s an inquiry, then it’s always a process.  We’re actually living something together.  This is where there is real energy.  Life energy.  The rest is just, again, divisive. 

(All these things…good, bad, right, wrong, true, false.  I think this is the advantage of the arts.  The arts aren’t about right and wrong.  At least the playing I try to open up is not about that.  Like, “When you played that note, how did that affect you?”  And it may be different, how it affected you.  Well, when you played it, I thought it was funny.  When you played it, it made you angry.  Cool, man.  When you want to make me laugh and you want to feel angry, play that.  E-flat.  Play that note at that point.  And maybe the next time, it will even have a different effect.  It’s much more playful.  It’s not all this black and white; it’s a lot of different colors.
