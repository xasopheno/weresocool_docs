### WereSoCool is a language for composing microtonal music. You might find this language useful if you want to make cool sounds and impress your friends/pets/plants. 

## `Origin` 

If you want to make sound in WereSoCool, you'll need a `.socool` file. At the top of your `.socool` file, you'll need an `origin`:
<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`{ f: 220, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }`}
/>

This expession defines the origin for our program. Every `.socool` file is essentially a series of operations on a point. 

##### f is your starting frequency. in this case, 220 which happens to be an "A".
##### l is your starting length in seconds. in this case, 1 second.
##### g is your starting gain. smaller is quieter, larger is louder.
##### p is your starting pan. 0 is in the middle. -1 is on the left. 1 is on the right 


Every `.socool` program also needs a `main` block. 

<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={
`main = {
  sounds_you_want_to_make
}`
}/>

## `Operation: Fm (Frequency Multiply)` 
We also need an operation in order to do anything cool. The first operation we'll use is `Fm`. This operation multiplies the frequency of it's input by the multiplier provided. Numbers in WereSoCool and be whole, decimal, or rational numbers. 

<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={
`-- lines that start with two dashs are comments and wont be run
-- Fm 1 is the Fm identity. 
Fm 1
-- Fm values greater than 1 will be bigger. 
-- An octave is a doubling of frequency, so Fm 2 is the same note up an octave and 
-- Fm 4 would be another octave above that. 
Fm 2
Fm 4
-- Fm values less than 1 will bring the frequency down. Fm 1/2 is the same note
-- down an octave
Fm 1/2
-- Fm 0 is silent.
Fm 0`
}/>

## Putting It All Together

Now, let's make our first cool sound. Since there haven't any other operations in our program, this operation will be applied directly to our `origin`.

Click play and you'll hear a sine wave at 220hz that lasts for 1 second before fading out. The gain is 1 and the sound is panned to 0 which is the center. 

#### Try changing the number in the Fm operation. Reminder: The number has to be >= 0. You can also change the values in the `origin` and see how it changes the sound.

<WereSoCool language={
-- lines that start with dashes are comments and will not be run
-- As songs get longer, you might want to 
-- stop them with cmd + enter (ctl + enter on linux/windows).
-- [SECRET] pressing Shift-Enter will play the main block
`{ f: 220, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Fm 1
}`
}/>
