title: WereSoCool Documentation

#### This language is a few years old now. It has changed a lot so far and I imagine it will contine to change...hopefully for the better. This doc will describe the current state of the language. 

## Numbers
- Numbers in WereSoCool may be any Integer, Decimal, or Rational number. 1, 1.314, and 2/3 are meaningful numbers in the language. 
- Under the hood, all calculations are done with Rational numbers until just before rendering in order to preserve accuracy. 

# Point Operations



## `Fm <number> - Frequency Multiply`

- Multiplies the input frequency by the number provided. 
- Value may be any Number >= 0. 
- Very high or very low values many not be audible. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Fm 5/4
}`
}/>

## `Fa <number> - Frequency Add`

- Adds the number provided to the input frequency. 
- Value may be any Number. 
- If the sum of the input frequency and the number provided is less than 0, the sound will be silent. In other words, the resulting frequency will be min(val, input.frequency + number)

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Fa -7
}`
}/>

## `Lm <number> - Length Multiply`

- Multiplies the input length by the number provided. 
- Value may be any Number >= 0. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Lm 3
}`
}/>

## `Gm <number> - Gain Multiply`

- Multiplies the input gain by the number provided. 
- Value may be any Number >= 0. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Gm 1/2
}`
}/>

## `Pm <number> - Pan Multiply`

- Multiplies the input pan by the number provided. 
- Value may be any number. 
- It is recommended to keep pan values between -1 and 1
- Positive numbers are panned left and negative numbers are panned right.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: -1 }\n
main = {
  Pm 7/8
}`
}/>

## `Pa <number> - Pan Add`

- Adds the number provided to the input pan. 
- Value may be any number. 
- It is recommended to keep pan values between -1 and 1
- Positive numbers are panned left and negative numbers are panned right.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Pa 9/10 
}`
}/>

# Group Operations

## `Seq [operations] - Sequence`

- Operations will performed in series. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
    Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 4/3, 
    Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3, Fm 15/8, Fm 2
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Overlay [operations]`

- Operations will performed at the same time. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1/3, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 7/2,
    Fm 9/4,
    Fm 3/2,
    Fa 5,
    Fm 1,
    Fm 1/2
  ]
}`
}/>

# Form Operations

## `AsIs - Identity`

- This operation is a no-op. Useful for describing form.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [ Fm 1, Fm 9/8 ]  
  | Seq [AsIs, Fm 3/2]
}`
}/>

## `Repeat <number>`
Repeat is super cool if you want to something to happen again. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/4, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
melody = {
  Seq [ Fm 5/4, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 1]
}\n
main = {
  Seq [
    melody | Repeat 3
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Reverse`
Reverse takes an input and plays it backwards. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/3, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
pentatonic_scale = {
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3]
}\n
main = {
  Seq [
    pentatonic_scale, 
    pentatonic_scale | Reverse
  ]
}`
}/>

## `FitLength`
Here, operation2 is something new you've written. 
operation1 is something you wrote earlier in the piece.
FitLength is going to stretch or squish operation2
to make it the same length as operation1. 

<WereSoCool
  language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
pentatonic_scale = {
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3]
}\n
bass = {
  Fm 1/2 |
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 7/8, Fm 5/6, Fm 2/3]
}\
main = {
  Overlay [
    pentatonic_scale, 
    bass | Seq [Fm 9/8, Fm 1] | FitLength pentatonic_scale
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Operation: ModBy` 
ModulateBy lets you use an operation to modulate another operation. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/3, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
melody = {
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2]
}\n
main = {
  Seq [
    melody,
    melody
    | ModBy [Fm 1, Fm 1/2]
  ]
}`
}/>


## `Invert`
Invert is an operation on Frequency which inverts the ratio of the current
current frequency over the f at the top of the file. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
pentatonic_scale = {
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3]
}\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    pentatonic_scale, 
    pentatonic_scale | Invert
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Functions` 
Any block except for the "main" block can be extended to 
take arguments. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/3, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
melody(a) = {
  a | Repeat 3
}\n
main = {
  melody(
    Seq [
      Fm 5/4, Fm 9/8, Fm 1
    ]
  )
}`
}/>

# Lists

## `List Syntax` 
Lists are denoted by an `&`. You can index into the list with an `@` followed by `[operations]`

<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`&[operations] @ [indices]`}
/>

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
-- List indices start at 0
main = {
  &[Fm 1, Fm 9/8] @ [0, 1, 0]
}`
}/>



## `ET - Equal Temperament` 
The ET operation creates an equal tempered scaled divided n times.
The result is a list and can be indexed into as needed. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/4, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  ET(17) 
}`
}/>

## `List Indices`

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/11, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  ET(12) 
  @ [
    -- You can choose elements by index
    0, 3, 4, 6, 9, 
    -- Slices can be used to select ranges of elements. 
    -- this slice will select the 3rd -> 7th element of the list
    -- The range is inclusive. 
    3:7,
    -- Slices can also go backwards. Again, slices are 
    -- inclusive, so this will choose indices 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2.
    8:2,
    -- Slices can also be passed a third argument called "skip".
    -- This will start from the 2nd element travel to the 10th
    -- skipping 3 at a time. 
    0:11:3,
    -- You've already seen Random(n). Which chooses random elements
    -- from the list. 
    Random(5),
    -- You can also apply operations to any index!
    Random(30) | Overlay [Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 15/8] | Gm 1/3,\n
    -- Quick silence. I'll be adding a silent index soon. 
    0 | Fm 0,\n
    -- For the win!
    11:2:2 
    | Fm 3/4 
    | Seq [Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 4/3, Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3]
    | Overlay [Fm 1, Fm 3/2, Fm 2]
    | Gm 1/3,\n
    8:4 
    | Fm 1/2 
    | Lm 1/2,\n
    3 
    | Fm 1/2 
    | Lm 4
    | Overlay [Fm 1, Fm 9/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/4] | Gm 1/4
  ]
}`
}/>
