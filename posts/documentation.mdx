#### This language is a few years old now. It has changed a lot so far and I imagine it will contine to change...hopefully for the better. This doc will describe the current state of the language. 

## Numbers
- Numbers in WereSoCool may be any Integer, Decimal, or Rational number. 1, 1.314, and 2/3 are meaningful numbers in the language. 
- Under the hood, all calculations are done with Rational numbers until just before rendering in order to preserve accuracy. 

# Point Operations

## `Fm <number> - Frequency Multiply`

- Multiplies the input frequency by the number provided. 
- Value may be any Number >= 0. 
- Very high or very low values many not be audible. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Fm 5/4
}`
}/>

## `Fa <number> - Frequency Add`

- Adds the number provided to the input frequency. 
- Value may be any Number. 
- If the sum of the input frequency and the number provided is less than 0, the sound will be silent. In other words, the resulting frequency will be min(val, input.frequency + number)

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Fa -7
}`
}/>

# Group Operations

## `Seq [operations] - Sequence`

- Operations will performed in series. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
    Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 4/3, 
    Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3, Fm 15/8, Fm 2
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Overlay [operations]`

- Operations will performed at the same time. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1/3, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 7/2,
    Fm 9/4,
    Fm 3/2,
    Fa 5,
    Fm 1,
    Fm 1/2
  ]
}`
}/>
