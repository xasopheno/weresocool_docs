title: FitLength
---

Once you've started writing songs with Overlays, you'll likely notice
that lining up the ends of phrases can be tedious. 
Luckily, the "FitLength" operations makes it super easy to align
the ends of operations. 

## `Operation: FitLength`
Here, operation2 is something new you've written. 
operation1 is something you wrote earlier in the piece.
FitLength is going to stretch or squish operation2
to make it the same length as operation1.

## `Operation: Invert`

In this example, you'll also see `Invert` being used.
Invert is an operation on Frequency which inverts the ratio of the current
current frequency over the f at the top of the file. 

<WereSoCool

  hideGutter
  language={
`operation | Invert`
}
/>

<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`Seq [operations]`}
/>

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
    Fm 1, 
  ]
}`
}/>
