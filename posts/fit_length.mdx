Once you've started writing songs with Overlays, you'll likely notice
that lining up the ends of phrases can be tedious. 
Luckily, the "FitLength" operations makes it super easy to align
the ends of operations. 

## `Operation: FitLength`
Here, operation2 is something new you've written. 
operation1 is something you wrote earlier in the piece.
FitLength is going to stretch or squish operation2
to make it the same length as operation1. 

<WereSoCool

  language={`operation2 | FitLength operation1`}

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/7, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
-- If we wrote this melody
melody = {
  Seq [
    Fm 2, Fm 15/8, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/4,
    Fm 9/8, Fm 1, Fm 5/6, Fm 1,
    Fm 3/4 | Lm 3
  ]
  | Seq [AsIs, Reverse]
}\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    -- We could add a low note that would stretch 
    -- to the length of the melody
    melody,
    Fm 1/2 
    -- Comment out the FitLength operation to see what
    -- would happen without it. 
    | FitLength melody
  ]
}`
}/>

You can create very complicated rhythmic relationships using Fitlength.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 311, l: 1/3, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
melody1 = {
  O[
    (1/1, 3, 1/2, 1/2),
    (1/1, 0, 1/2, -1/2),
    (3/4, 0, 1/2, 0),
  ]
  | Seq [
    Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3 | Lm 3/2, 
    Seq [Fm 2, Fm 5/3] | Lm 1/2,
    Fm 3/2, Fm 1
  ]
}\n
melody2 = {
  O[
    (1/2, 1, 1/2, -1),
    (1/2, 0, 1/2, 1)
  ]
  | Seq [
    Fm 3/4, Fm 5/6, Fm 5/4, Fm 2/3, Fm 5/4, Fm 9/4 
  ]
}\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    melody1,
    melody2 
    | Seq [Fm 1, Fm 7/8]
    | FitLength melody1
  ]
  | Repeat 3
}`
