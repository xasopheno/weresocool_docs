title: More Expressive Generators
---

Generators are super cool. Let's keep going with them. 

### Infinte Melodies

We are going to stay in ET(12) for now. Using generators, we
can make some beautiful, long and winding melodic structures. 
Mark Turner, eat your heart out.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/8, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
-- Three Melodies from generators. 
main = {
  Overlay [Fm 1/2, Fm 1, Fm 2]
  | Seq [
    *(
      f: 0|12 [7, -3, -4, -2, 1]
    ) Take 30,
    Fm 0,
    *(
      f: 0|12 [-3, 4, 3, 2, -4, 2, 1, -2]
    ) Take 25,
    Fm 0,
    *(
      f: 0|12 [2, -3, 2, -5, 10, -1, -1, -1, -1]
    ) Take 28,
  ]
}`
}/>

# Time Feels
Oh, musicians love to talk about time feel. One of the 
biggest compliments you can give someone. 
"Man...she has the best time feel..." 
For a programming language, I think WereSoCool
has a pretty good time feel. Generators are 
a really nice place to explore the relationship
between melody, tempo, and time feel. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/5, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
-- Three different time feels from generators. 
main = {
  Overlay [Fm 1/2, Fm 1, Fm 2]
  | Seq [
    -- Swinging, but relatively straight
    *(
        f: 0|12 [7, -3, -4, -2, 1],
        l: 13|13 [-3, 3],
        -- These gain generators accent the upbeats
        g: 10|10 [-3, 3]
    ) Take 31,
    Fm 0,
    -- Pretty swinging
    *(
        f: 0|12 [7, -3, -4, -2, 1],
        l: 15|13 [-6, 6],
        g: 10|10 [-3, 3]
    ) Take 31,
    Fm 0,
    -- Quite swung.
    *(
        f: 0|12 [7, -3, -4, -2, 1],
        l: 16|13 [-8, 8],
        g: 10|10 [-3, 3]
    ) Take 31
  ]
}
`
}/>

# Dynamics
Any easy way to add dynamics to something you have already
written is to ModBy [generator].

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/6, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
-- Three different time feels from generators. 
main = {
  Overlay [Fm 1/2, Fm 1, Fm 2]
  | ET(12) @ [Random(35)]
  | ModBy [
    *(g: 10|10 [-1]) Take 10
  ]
}`
}/>
