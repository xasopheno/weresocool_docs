### Multiples

-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1. 

That is a strange thing to write. WereSoCool
has a shorthand for multiple coefficients in a row in 
a generator. You can use `*` to say how many of a coefficient
should happen in a row,

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/10, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  *(
    -- essentially, go up 4 half steps 3 times
    -- then go down 5 half steps 3 times
    -- keep doing that until you get to 40
    f: 0|12 [4*3, -5*3]
  ) Take 40
  | Repeat 3
}`
}/>
