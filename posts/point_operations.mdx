title: Point Operations
---

Let's take a moment to look at all of the `Point Operations` These operations are the basis of all other operations.

**Some operations are "no-ops"**. They act as an identity.
For example: 
cool | Fm 1 | Gm 1 | Lm 1 = cool

## `Fm <number> - Frequency Multiply`

- Multiplies the input frequency by the number provided. 
- Value may be any Number >= 0. 
- Very high or very low values many not be audible. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Fm 5/4
}`
}/>

## `Fa <number> - Frequency Add`

- Adds the number provided to the input frequency. 
- Value may be any Number. 
- If the sum of the input frequency and the number provided is less than 0, the sound will be silent. In other words, the resulting frequency will be min(val, input.frequency + number)

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Fa -7
}`
}/>

## `Lm <number> - Length Multiply`

- Multiplies the input length by the number provided. 
- Value may be any Number >= 0. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Lm 3
}`
}/>

## `Gm <number> - Gain Multiply`

- Multiplies the input gain by the number provided. 
- Value may be any Number >= 0. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Gm 1/2
}`
}/>

## `Pm <number> - Pan Multiply`

- Multiplies the input pan by the number provided. 
- Value may be any number. 
- It is recommended to keep pan values between -1 and 1
- Positive numbers are panned left and negative numbers are panned right.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: -1 }\n
main = {
  Pm 7/8
}`
}/>

## `Pa <number> - Pan Add`

- Adds the number provided to the input pan. 
- Value may be any number. 
- It is recommended to keep pan values between -1 and 1
- Positive numbers are panned left and negative numbers are panned right.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Pa 9/10 
}`
}/>
