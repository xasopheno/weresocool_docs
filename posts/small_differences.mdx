title: Small Differences 
---

We have explored sound that seperated by big distances like octaves. What about sounds that are really close together. Lets listen to two sine waves 1 hz apart.
A hertz is defined as one cycle per seconed. You'll here that two pitches 1hz apart create a beating sound with a 1 second cycle.


<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fa 1,
    Fa 0,
  ]
  -- If you uncomment the line below, you can hear that the 
  -- beating sound stays the same even when the frequencies change.
  -- | Seq [Fm 1/2, Fm 1, Fm 2]
}`
}/>


We can make cool rhythms by building harmonies that take advantage of this beating sound. Listen to the following interval - the ratio of 3/2 or a perfect 5th - which is also imbued with the rhythm of 3 against 2 thanks to the use of `Fa`.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1/2, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 3/2, 
    Fm 3/2 | Fa 3,
    Fa 2,
    Fa 0,
  ]
}`
}/>

Interesting things happen when you separate these small differences in space by panning them. I recommend listening to this in headphones or stereo speakers. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1/3, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 9/4 | Fa 3 | Pa 1,
    Fm 9/4 | Pa 1,
    Fm 3/2 | Pa -1, 
    Fm 3/2 | Fa 2 | Pa -1,
    Fa 1 | Pa -1,
    Fa 0 | Pa 1,
    Fm 1/2 | Fa 1,
    Fm 1/2,
  ]
}`
}/>

## Cool Chord

We can end this experiment with a cool chord. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 17/4 | Fa 8 | Gm 1/8 | Pa -1,
    Fm 17/4 | Pa -1 | Gm 1/8,\n
    Fm 13/4 | Fa -6,  Gm 1/8 | Pa 9/10,
    Fm 13/4 | Fa 7 | Pa 9/10 | Gm 1/8,\n
    Fm 5/2 | Fa 7 | Pa 1/2,
    Fm 5/2 | Pa -1/2,\n
    Fm 11/8 | Pa 2/3,
    Fm 11/8 | Fa 1 | Pa 2/3,\n
    Fm 9/4 | Pa -1/3,
    Fm 9/4 | Fa 4 | Pa -1/3,\n
    Fm 2 | Gm 1/2 | Pa 1/2,
    Fm 2 | Fa 4 | Gm 1/2 | Pa 1/2,\n
    Fm 5/3 | Fa -9 | Gm 1/4 | Pa 1,
    Fm 5/3 | Gm 1/4 | Pa -1,\n
    Fm 1/2,    
    Fm 1/2 | Fa 2/3,    
    Fm 1/4 | Gm 1/16,    
    Fm 1/4 | Fa 1/3 | Gm 1/16,    
  ]
  | Lm 8
  | Gm 1/4
}`
}/>
