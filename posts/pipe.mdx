## `Operation: operation | operation - Pipe` 
One of the most import Operations in this language is "|" (Pipe), 
because it allows you to chain together operations.


<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
    -- Operations are cumulative, so:
    -- Fm 3/2 | Fm 5/4 == Fm 15/8
    Fm 1,
    Fm 3/2 | Fm 5/4,
    Fm 1,
    Fm 15/8
  ]
}`

-- We can factor out our major_scale into its own block.

        Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3, Fm 15/8, Fm 2
  ]
}\n
main = {
  Seq [
    -- We can use the major scale block by name here.
    major_scale,
    -- Now we can use the pipe operation to play a major scale up a step and twice as fast
    major_scale
    -- multiply all the frequencies in our major_scale by 9/8 to go up one step.
    | Fm 9/8 
    -- multiply all the length of all the notes in our 
    -- major_scale by 1/2
    | Lm 1/2
