title: Intro Generators

Generators make it possible to describe an infinite lists in WereSoCool.

A generator is a collection of
Axis Expressions. Generators start with at `*`.

### Axis Expressions
<WereSoCool

  language={
`axis: start|subdivision [coefficients]`
}/>

An axis expression has 4 parts 
- axis, start, subdivision, coefficients

### Axis
There are four axis in WereSoCool: 
Frequency, Length, Gain and Pan. 
f, l, g, and p in the context of a generator.

### Subdivision
A slightly trickly part. This depends on the axis. For 
Length, Gain, and Pan, we are dividing 1 in into that many 
subdivions. For frequency, we are dividing and octave into that
many parts. We're create a generator in ET(n) space. 

### Start
We're going slightly out of order since you need to know what 
the subdivision is doing before you can understand what the start 
means. Start says, "Calculate the starting value for this axis
on this generator by taking the input value on that axis and 
adding start * subdivision". There are some examples below that 
will hopefully make this clearer. 

### Coefficients
The coefficients describe the change in the axis at each step. 
The coefficients are looped infinitely. 

## Chromatic Scale Generator

The following is an Axis Expression for a 
chromatic scale generator. I read it as:
On the frequency axis, start at the input 
frequency * (0 * subdivision). Each step, add 
1 * subdivision to the last frequency.

`f: 0|12 [1]`
}/>

### Take

The last part of the Generator is Take. Since generators
are infinite, you should be explicit how many steps 
you'd like to take. Generators actually have some defaults
in place and will make sounds without a take, but it is 
always best to use a Take. 

Here we will use our Chromatic Scale Axis Expression 
inside a Generator and then Take 12. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 311.127, l: 1/6, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  *(
    f: 0|12 [1]
  ) Take 12
}`
}/>

## More Axis Expressions

In order to make it clear what the generators are doing, 
we are going to add a little attack at the beginning of each note. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 311.127, l: 1/6, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  -- I usually describe the attack of a note as an Overlay 
  -- of Fm 1 and then a sequence that describes the attack.
  Overlay [
    Fm 1,
    -- Fm 2 is the frequency of the attack, the first 
    -- Fm 0 is the decay of that attack, and the second
    -- Fm 0 is the silence after the decay.
    Seq [Fm 2, Fm 0, Fm 0] | Lm 1/8,
  ]
  | Repeat 4
}`
}/>

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 311.127, l: 1/6, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 1,
    Seq [Fm 2, Fm 0, Fm 0] | Lm 1/8,
  ]
  | *(
    f: 0|12 [1]
  ) Take 12
}`
}/>

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 311.127, l: 1/5, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 1,
    Seq [Fm 2, Fm 0, Fm 0] | Lm 1/8,
  ]
  | *(
    g: 10|10 [-1],
  ) Take 10
  | Repeat 3
}`
}/>

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 311.127, l: 1/2, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 1,
    Seq [Fm 2, Fm 0, Fm 0] | Lm 1/8,
  ]
  | *(
    l: 10|10 [-1],
  ) Take 10
  | Repeat 3
}`
}/>

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 311.127, l: 1/6, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 1,
    Seq [Fm 2, Fm 0, Fm 0] | Lm 1/8,
  ]
  | *(
    p: 5|5 [-1],
  ) Take 10
  | Repeat 3
}`
}/>

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 311.127, l: 1/3, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Seq [Fm 2, Fm 0 | Lm 8] | Lm 1/10,
    Fm 1,
    Fm 1/2,
  ]
  | *(
    f: 0|12 [1],
    g: 10|10 [-1],
    l: 10|10 [-1],
    p: 5|5 [-1],
  ) Take 10
  | Repeat 3
}`
}/>
