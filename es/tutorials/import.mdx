## `Operation: import` 

You can import compositions from other `.socool` files. 

The default behavior is to use the socool file name as the base name for the import, but you can use `as` syntax to rename the import. 

Having imported the file, you can use dot notation to access the part of the imported composition you want to use.

  language={
`import some_dir/thing_from_other_file.socool
import ../../other_dir/cool_thing.socool as whoa

{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    thing_from_other_file.melody,
    whoa.main
  ]
}`
}/>
