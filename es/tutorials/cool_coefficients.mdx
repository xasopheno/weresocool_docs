### Multiples

-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1. 

That is a strange thing to write. WereSoCool
has a shorthand for multiple coefficients in a row in 
a generator. You can use `*` to say how many of a coefficient
should happen in a row,

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/10, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  *(
    -- essentially, go up 4 half steps 3 times
    -- then go down 5 half steps 3 times
    -- keep doing that until you get to 40
    f: 0|12 [4*3, -5*3]
  ) Take 40
  | Repeat 3
}`
}/>

### Math Expressions
These are both experimental syntaxes. start|division works a bit differntly. 
For all axes, the function is Poly
or Expr is applied starting at the start and stepping forward
through the subdivions. So, 9|10 would start at 9/10 and then
the next values would be the result of the expression applied
to 10/10 followed by the expression applied to 11/10. On the frequency
axis, the result is normalized to log space. 

### Poly - Polynomials
Creates a Polynomial from a list of coefficients in ascending order.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/10, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  *(
    -- -1/3x^2 + x + 2
    f: 0|12 Poly [2, 1, -1/3]
  ) Take 70
}`
}/>

### Expr - Expressions

#### Operations
> +, -, *, /

#### Functions
> sqrt, abs

> exp, ln, log10

> sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2

> sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh

#### Constants
> pi, e

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/10, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  *(
    f: 0|12 Expr \`sin(5 * x)\`
  ) Take 70
}`
}/>
