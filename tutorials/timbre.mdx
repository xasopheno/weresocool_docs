Timbre operations change the waveform generated by an oscillator. Be careful when moving from one timbre to and other in the same voice, it won't always work well. It's best to either create a new voice or add a space when you want to change oscillator type.

## `Operation: Sine` 

The `Sine` operation applies the folowing formula to each sample. `Sine 1` is the default WereSoCool cool sound. 

`sin(phase^power) / power`.


<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`--power needs to be a value larger than 0.\n
  Sine <power>`}
/>


<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 161.6, l: 2, g: 1/2, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 0 | Lm 1/4]
  | Seq [
    Sine 1, 
    Sine 1.5, 
    Sine 2.0, 
    Sine 2.5, 
    Sine 3, 
    Sine 3.5,
    Sine 0.5,
    Sine 1, 
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Operation: Tri` 

The `Tri` operation applies the folowing formula to each sample. 

`(abs(sin(phase^power)) * 2 - 1) / power` 

<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`--power needs to be a value larger than 0.\n
  Tri <power>`}
/>


<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 161.6, l: 2, g: 1/2, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 0 | Lm 1/4]
  | Seq [
    Tri 1, 
    Tri 1.5, 
    Tri 2.0, 
    Tri 2.5, 
    Tri 3, 
    Tri 3.5,
    Tri 0.5,
    Tri 1, 
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Operation: Square` 

The `Square` can be thought of as a pulse_width operation. The value in any given sample is calculated with the
formula:

s = sin(phase);
if s > pulse_width { -1. } else { 1. };

The default pulse_width is 0.5

<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`--The pulse_width needs to be a value > 0 and < 1\n
  Square <pulse_width>`}
/>


<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 161.6, l: 2, g: 1/2, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 0 | Lm 1/4]
  | Seq [
    Square 0.1, 
    Square 0.5, 
    Square 0.75, 
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Operation: Noise` 

A noise generator

<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`--You can move Noise around with Fm\n
  Noise`}
/>


<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 161.6, l: 2, g: 1/2, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [Fm 1, Fm 0 | Lm 1/4]
  | Seq [
    Noise, 
    Noise | Fm 4,
    Noise | Fm 8,
    Noise | Fm 16,
  ]
}`
}/>
