So far, we've only explored intervals melodically. Now, we'll add a new Operation - Overlay - which will allow us to explore intervals harmonically.


## `Operation: Overlay` 
<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`Overlay [operations]`}
/>

Overlay takes an array of operations and peforms them at the same time. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 3, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  -- C Major Triad. Oooh, Aaaah.
  Overlay [
    Fm 3/2,
    Fm 5/4,
    Fm 1, 
  ]
}`
}/>

How about a Sequence of Overlays? Chords written above each Overlay.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
    -- I - C
    Overlay [
      Fm 3/2,
      Fm 5/4,
      Fm 1, 
    ],
    -- IV - F
    Overlay [
      Fm 5/3,
      Fm 4/3,
      Fm 1, 
    ],
    -- I - C
    Overlay [
      Fm 3/2,
      Fm 5/4,
      Fm 1, 
    ],
    -- V - G
    Overlay [
      Fm 3/2,
      Fm 9/8,
      Fm 15/16, 
    ],
    -- I - C
    Overlay [
      Fm 3/2,
      Fm 5/4,
      Fm 1, 
    ],
  ]
}`
}/>

# More Overtone Exploration

You'll see a BeautifulChart(tm) on the right of the WereSoCool Editor below. You can use this chart to get your bearings in the rich landscape of ratio-based harmony. Ratios in surrounded by Gold Boxes are the ratios that describe the major scale. Ratios of similar dissonace are the same color. There are a lot of new intervals to explore that you might have never heard of. Sub-minor third? Yes, please. Super Major Third? Heck Yeah.

<WSCWithRatioChart language={`{ f: 440, l: 5, g: 1/2, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 13/4,
    Fm 5/2,
    Fm 9/4,
    Fm 7/4,
    Fm 12/7,
    Fm 3/2,
    Fm 5/4,
    Fm 7/6,
    Fm 1/2,
  ]
}`
