Before continuing, we can add a couple more operations to our repertoire. 

## `Reverse`
Reverse takes an input and plays it backwards. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/6, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
major_scale = {
  Seq [
    Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 4/3, 
    Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3, Fm 15/8, Fm 2
  ]
}\n
main = {
  Seq [
    major_scale, 
    major_scale | Reverse
  ]
}`
}/>

## `Repeat <number>`
Repeat is super cool if you want to something to happen again. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/4, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
melody = {
  Seq [ Fm 5/4, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 1]
}\n
main = {
  Seq [
    melody | Repeat 3
  ]
}`
}/>

# Sequence | Sequence 

If you've been following along, you might be wondering, 
what happens when you do something like this?:

`Seq [op1, op2, ...] | Seq [op3, op4, ...]`

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 220, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
-- We need a cool sound in order to explore this new idea. 
-- This is a pentatonic_scale. It is a cool subset of the major_scale.
pentatonic_scale = {
	Seq [
      Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4,  
      Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3 
  ]
  -- 8x faster...wheeee!
  | Lm 1/8
}\n
main = { 
  -- Now we will pipe the pentatonic_scale into the Seq [Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4]. 
  -- The result will be the pentatonic_scale moving up in whole steps
  pentatonic_scale
  | Seq [
      Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4,
      -- ===== uncomment the following line with cmd + / (ctl + / on linux/windows)======
      -- Fm 9/8 | Reverse
      -- Reverse is super cool. It takes what ever you Pipe into it
      -- and reverses it. Simple as that. 
  ]
  -- ===== and uncomment the following line with cmd + / (ctl + / on linux/windows)
  -- | Repeat 4
}`
}/>

# Congratulations!
You now know enough to start making some pretty cool things. 
Before going continuing with the tutorial, 
I recommend trying to make your own piece starting with this one.
A good starting place would be to change the pentatonic_scale to be 
another set of operation. Perhaps, add an additional `Fm` or 
`Pipe` the current composition into another Sequence.
