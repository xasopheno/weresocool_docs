title: Stems
---

## `Operation: Stems` 
You can use the WereSoCool CLI to print stems. 
Pipe a word starting with a hash tag (#) into 
an any operation. 

You can imagine the tag cascading through the 
language and anything it touches on the way 
to becoming a sound will become a part of that stem. 

On the main block you can use the following syntax 
to choose stems to print. 
`main = { ops } -> [list_of_stems]`

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
thing1 = {
  #stem1 | Seq [Fm 1, Fm 9/8]
}\n
thing2 = {
  #stem2 | Seq [Fm 3/2, Fm 9/8]
}\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    thing1,
  ]
  | Seq [AsIs | Repeat 2, Reverse]
  | Repeat 3
} -> [stem1, stem2]`
}/>
