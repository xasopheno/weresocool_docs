## `Operation: Seq` 
The next most useful operation is the Sequence or Seq operation.

We can use `Seq` to create a series of sounds. Follows are the first 12 notes of the overtone series starting at 261.6hz - a "C" on the piano.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/7, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
    Fm 1, 
    Fm 2, 
    Fm 3, 
    Fm 4, 
    Fm 5, 
    Fm 6, 
    Fm 7, 
    Fm 8,
    Fm 9,
    Fm 10, 
    Fm 11, 
    Fm 12
  ]

## Discovering Intervals

There are intervals that show up in music all over the world. Where do they come from? They come from a structure in nature that's called the overtone series. Let's explore the overtone series and find some old and new sounds. 


Before we have intervals, we have unison - Fm 1 and Fm 1. Following unison is the doubling and halving of frequencies which we saw in the last tutorial. A doubled frequency is known as an octave in western music theory (WMT). Another way to say it that the distance between the 1st and 2nd overtones is an octave. 


What about the distance between the 2nd and 3rd overtones? The name in WMT is the `Perfect 5th`. Listen below to the interval. First in the natural position in the overtone series and then the ratio used directly so that it is in relationship `Fm 1`.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
  -- First in their natural position in the overtone series.
    Fm 2, 
    Fm 3, 
    Fm 2, 
  -- And now we will use the interval directly -- 3/2 -- which will sound in
  -- the same octave as the fundamental. 
    Fm 1, 
    Fm 3/2, 
    Fm 1, 
  ]
}`
}/>

We can discover all sorts of beautiful and useful intervals by exploring the distances between the natural overtone series.


Here's an C Major Scale (261.6hz is an A) built using ratios from the overtone series. The first note is the fundamental. The second is the distance between the 9th and 8th. The third interval is the distance between the 5th and 4th overtones...etc...

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/3, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
    Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 4/3, 
    Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3, Fm 15/8, Fm 2
  ]
}`
}/>

Now we can create all sorts of wonderful melodies and discover new, cool intervals. Take a moment to write your own melody.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/7, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Seq [
    Fm 1, Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3, 
    Fm 7/4, Fm 2, Fm 3/2, Fm 9/8, 
    
    Fm 1, Fm 25/24, Fm 9/8, Fm 6/5, 
    Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 15/8, Fm 3/2,
    
    Fm 2, Fm 9/8, Fm 4/3, Fm 5/3, 
    Fm 3/2, Fm 4/3, Fm 5/4, Fm 9/8, 
    
    Fm 1, Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 2, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/4, Fm 1/2
  ]
