## `List` 
Lists are denoted by an `&`. You can index into the list with an `@` followed by `[operations]` Lists do not
yet support negative indices, but I'm sure I'll get around to 
it at some point. 

<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={`&[op1, op2, op3, ...] @ [indices]`}
/>

### Basic List

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
-- List indices start at 0
main = {
  &[Fm 1, Fm 9/8] @ [0, 1, 0]
}`
}/>


### Lists and Random

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1/4, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
-- We can also choose indices randomly
-- Every time you play it, it will be different
main = {
  &[Fm 0, Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 3/2] @ [Random(8)]
}`
}/>

### A Composition Using Lists

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 285, l: 1, g: 1/5, p: 0 }\n
overtones = {
  Overlay[
    (2/1, -3, 1, 1),
    {2/1, 0, 1, -1},
    {1/1, 3, 1, 1},
    {1/1, 0, 1, -1},
    {1/2, 0, 1, 1},
    {1/2, 3, 1, -1},
  ]
}\n
-- This is a list declaration. 
-- In this list, you'll find a major scale with
-- with a silence (Fm 0) at the end. 
cool_list = &[
  Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4, Fm 4/3,
  Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3, Fm 15/8, Fm 2,
  Fm 0,
]\n 
main = {
  overtones
  | Seq [
    -- First in the sequence is the list played as 
    -- a sequence. 
    &cool_list,
    -- Next, the list indexed into. The syntax for indices is:
    -- &list_name @ [index1, index2, index 3, etc]
    &cool_list @ [
      0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 
      7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 8
    ],
    -- There are some special kinds of indices in the language. 
    -- Random(n) is a special kind of index that will 
    -- chose n random elements from your list
    &cool_list @ [Random(30)] | Lm 2/3,
    -- And here's a little melody to end our phrase. 
    Seq [
      Fm 3/2,
      Fm 15/16, 
      Fm 1
    ] 
    | Lm 3
  ]
  | Lm 1/7
}`
}/>
