We have explored sound that seperated by big distances like octaves. What about sounds that are really close together. Lets listen to two sine waves 1 hz apart.
A hertz is defined as one cycle per seconed. You'll here that two pitches 1hz apart create a beating sound with a 1 second cycle.


<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fa 1,
    Fa 0,
  ]
  -- If you uncomment the line below, you can 
  -- hear the beating sound stays consistent 
  -- even when the frequencies change.
  -- | Seq [Fm 1/2, Fm 1, Fm 2]
}`
}/>


We can make cool rhythms by building harmonies that take advantage of this beating sound. Listen to the following interval - the ratio of 3/2 or a perfect 5th - which is also imbued with the rhythm of 3 against 2 thanks to the use of `Fa`.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1/2, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 3/2, 
    Fm 3/2 | Fa 3,
    Fa 2,
    Fa 0,
  ]
}`
}/>

Interesting things happen when you separate these small differences in space by panning them. I recommend listening to this in headphones or stereo speakers. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 5, g: 1/3, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 9/4 | Fa 3 | Pa 1,
    Fm 9/4 | Pa 1,
    Fm 3/2 | Pa -1, 
    Fm 3/2 | Fa 2 | Pa -1,
    Fa 1 | Pa -1,
    Fa 0 | Pa 1,
    Fm 1/2 | Fa 1,
    Fm 1/2,
  ]
}`
}/>

## A Cool Chord

We can end this experiment with a cool chord. 

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
  Overlay [
    Fm 17/4 | Fa 8 | Pa 3/10 | Gm 1/2,
    Fm 17/4 | Pa -9/10 | Gm 1/2,
    Fm 13/4 | Fa -6 | Gm 1/2 | Pa -3/10,
    Fm 13/4 | Fa 7 | Gm 1/2 | Pa 9/10,
    Fm 5/2 | Fa 1 | Pa 1/2,
    Fm 5/2 | Pa -1/2,\n
    Fm 9/4 | Fa 3 | Pa 1,
    Fm 9/4 | Pa 1,
    Fm 3/2 | Pa -1, 
    Fm 3/2 | Fa 2 | Pa -1,
    Fa 1 | Pa -1,
    Fa 0 | Pa 1,
    Fm 1/2 | Fa 1,
    Fm 1/2,\n
    Fm 1/4 | Fa 1 | Gm 1/6,
  ]
  | Lm 8
  | Gm 1/4
}`
}/>
