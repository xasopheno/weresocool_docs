**<CoolText>WereSoCool</CoolText>** is a programming language for composing microtonal music. You might find this language useful if you want to make cool sounds and impress your friends/pets/plants. 

This language does not require familiarity with either microtonal music or computer programming, but experience with either will certainly help. 

The **WereSoCool CLI** is availble on **macOS**, **Linux** and **Windows**. You can also explore the language on Firefox and Chrome browsers in the **<CoolLink href={"/playground"}>WereSoCool Playground</CoolLink>**. Live coding in the browser currently only works on desktop in a Firefox or Chrome browser. On mobile, you can still view the tutorials, but you won't be able to hear anything.

My recommended approach to learning the language is to do the tutorials in order and write your own composition after completing each one.

## Installing the WereSoCool CLI

### Cargo:

WereSoCool can be installed on macos, linux, and windows via cargo. You'll also need to install the system dependancies listed in the development section. 

Cargo is the rust package manager for Rust. Install cargo by installing <CoolLink href={"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html"}>Rustup</CoolLink>. After installing Cargo, run:

`cargo install weresocool`

<Break/>

### macOS:
The **<CoolText>WereSoCool CLI</CoolText>** is available on macOS via the homebrew package manager. If you do not have Homebrew installed, follow the installation instructions <CoolLink href={"https://brew.sh/"}>here</CoolLink>.

Install WereSoCool from Homebrew by running the following commands:

`brew tap xasopheno/weresocool && brew install weresocool`

<Break/>

### Arch Linux:

Available on the <CoolLink href={"https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/weresocool"}>AUR</CoolLink>!

<Break/>


### Windows:

This software runs on Windows, in a slightly limited capacity. On Windows, this software is compiled without mp3 and oggvorbis support (you can only print to wav, csv, and json). I mostly work on macos and linux machines, so I feel a bit out of my depths in Windows land. If you'd like to help work on the Windows implementation, please reach out. 

You can install WereSoCool from source or via cargo.

### From Source:
You'll need Cargo and Just.

Cargo is the rust package manager for Rust. Install cargo by installing <CoolLink href={"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html"}>Rustup</CoolLink>.

You'll also need to install <CoolLink href={"https://github.com/casey/just"}>Just</CoolLink> - a cool cross-platform command runner. 

You can install from this source code by cloning this repo and then running:

`just install`


<Break/>

## WereSoCool Playground:
 You can make cool sounds in on Firefox and Chrome browsers in the **<CoolLink href={"/playground"}>WereSoCool Playground</CoolLink>**. WereSoCool is single-threaded in the browser, so more complicated compositions will probably not render without clicks. The playground does not yet run on mobile.

## Editor Support
Some simple syntax highlighting is available for a few common editors. If you'd like to create a plugin for your favorite editor, please reach out. 

<Break/>

### Vim
My editor of choice is currently NeoVim, so support on vim is ahead of other browsers. The package is available on <CoolLink href={"https://github.com/xasopheno/WereSoCool_vim"}>Github</CoolLink>.

If you use vim-plug, add the following line to you `init.vim` and run `:PlugInstall`

`Plug 'xasopheno/weresocool_vim'`

<Break/>

### VisualStudio Code
Minimal syntax highlight is availble via the weresocool extension. Search for 'weresocool' in extensions or <CoolLink href={"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=weresocool.socool"}> install it from the marketplace.</CoolLink>
<Break/>

### SublimeText
Minimal syntax highlight is availble via the weresocool package. You can find it on <CoolLink href={"https://github.com/xasopheno/weresocool_sublimetext"}>Github</CoolLink>.
