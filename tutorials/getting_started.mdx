**<CoolText>WereSoCool</CoolText>** is a programming language for composing microtonal music. You might find this language useful if you want to make cool sounds and impress your friends/pets/plants. WereSoCool is available as a command line tool on macOS and Linux. You can also explore the language on Firefox and Chrome browsers in the **<CoolText>WereSoCool Playground</CoolText>** . 


## WereSoCool CLI

### macOS
The **<CoolText>WereSoCool CLI</CoolText>** is available on macOS via the homebrew package manager. If you do not have Homebrew installed, follow the installation instructions <CoolLink href={"https://brew.sh/"}>here</CoolLink>.

Install WereSoCool from Homebrew by running the following commands:

`brew tap xasopheno/weresocool`

`brew install weresocool`

<Break/>

### Arch Linux
`pacman -S weresocool`

<Break/>

### Linux - Debian and Rpm
Debian and rpm packages are generated with each new release of WereSoCool. You can download them on <CoolLink href={"https://github.com/xasopheno/WereSoCool/releases/latest"}>Github</CoolLink>.

If you would like to create a package for your favorite distro, please reach out.

<Break/>

### Windows
WereSoCool does not currently run on Windows. The underlying technologies are cross-platform, so it's certainly possible. I just don't have a machine to test it on. If you'd like to help get it running on Windows, please reach out. 

<Break/>

## WereSoCool Playground
 You can make cool sounds in on Firefox and Chrome browsers in the **<CoolLink href={"https://www.weresocool.org/playground"}>WereSoCool Playground</CoolLink>**. WereSoCool is single-threaded in the browser, so more complicated compositions will probably not render without clicks. The playground does not yet run on mobile.

## Editor Support
Some simple syntax highlighting is available for a few common editors. If you'd like to create a plugin for your favorite editor, please reach out. 

<Break/>

### Vim
My editor of choice is currently NeoVim, so support on vim is ahead of other browsers. The package is available on <CoolLink href={"https://github.com/xasopheno/WereSoCool_vim"}>Github</CoolLink>.

If you use vim-plug, add the following line to you `init.vim` and run `:PlugInstall`

`Plug 'xasopheno/WereSoCool_vim'`

<Break/>

### VisualStudio Code
Minimal syntax highlight is availble via the weresocool extension. Search for 'weresocool' in extensions or <CoolLink href={"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=weresocool.socool"}> install it from the marketplace.</CoolLink>
<Break/>

### SublimeText
Very minimal syntax highlight is availble via the weresocool package.
