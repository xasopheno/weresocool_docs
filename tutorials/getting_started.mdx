**<CoolText>WereSoCool</CoolText>** is a programming language for composing microtonal music. You might find this
language useful if you want to make cool sounds and impress your friends/pets/plants. WereSoCool is available as a
command line tool on macOS, Linux and Windows. You can also explore the language on Firefox and Chrome browsers in the **<CoolText>WereSoCool Playground</CoolText>** . 


## Installing the WereSoCool CLI

### From Source:
You'll need Cargo and optionally Just.

Rust: Cargo is the rust package manager for Rust. Install cargo by installing [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

You can install from this source code by cloning this repo and then running:

1) If you have `just` installed, run `just install`
    - Just is a command runner. Learn how to install just [here](https://github.com/casey/just).

2) Or run `cargo install --path .` from the root of the repo.

### macOS:
The **<CoolText>WereSoCool CLI</CoolText>** is available on macOS via the homebrew package manager. If you do not have Homebrew installed, follow the installation instructions <CoolLink href={"https://brew.sh/"}>here</CoolLink>.

Install WereSoCool from Homebrew by running the following commands:

`brew tap xasopheno/weresocool && brew install weresocool`

<Break/>

### Arch Linux:

Available on the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/weresocool).

<Break/>

### Cargo:

WereSoCool can be installed on macos, linux, and windows via cargo. You'll also need to install the system dependancies listed in the development section. 

 Install cargo by installing [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

`cargo install weresocool`

<Break/>

### Windows:

This software runs on Windows, but in a slightly limited capacity. On Windows, this software is compiled without mp3 and oggvorbis support. I mostly work on macos and linux machines, so I feel a bit out of my depths in Windows land. If you'd like to help work on the Windows implementation, please reach out. 

You can install WereSoCool from source or via cargo. See above. 


<Break/>

## WereSoCool Playground:
 You can make cool sounds in on Firefox and Chrome browsers in the **<CoolLink href={"https://www.weresocool.org/playground"}>WereSoCool Playground</CoolLink>**. WereSoCool is single-threaded in the browser, so more complicated compositions will probably not render without clicks. The playground does not yet run on mobile.

## Editor Support
Some simple syntax highlighting is available for a few common editors. If you'd like to create a plugin for your favorite editor, please reach out. 

<Break/>

### Vim
My editor of choice is currently NeoVim, so support on vim is ahead of other browsers. The package is available on <CoolLink href={"https://github.com/xasopheno/WereSoCool_vim"}>Github</CoolLink>.

If you use vim-plug, add the following line to you `init.vim` and run `:PlugInstall`

`Plug 'xasopheno/weresocool_vim'`

<Break/>

### VisualStudio Code
Minimal syntax highlight is availble via the weresocool extension. Search for 'weresocool' in extensions or <CoolLink href={"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=weresocool.socool"}> install it from the marketplace.</CoolLink>
<Break/>

### SublimeText
Very minimal syntax highlight is availble via the weresocool package.
