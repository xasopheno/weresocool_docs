## `ET - Equal Temperament` 
The ET operation creates an equal tempered scaled divided n times.
This results in a List that can be indexed into.

### ET(12)

### Equal Temperament vs Ratio Based Harmony

An equal temperament is a musical temperament or tuning system, 
which approximates just intervals by dividing an octave 
(or other interval) into equal steps. 
This means the ratio of the frequencies of any 
adkacent pair of notes is the same, which gives an 
equal perceived step size as pitch is perceived roughly 
as the logarithm of frequency. - Wikipedia

Western music is mostly written in 12-tone equal temperament 
We divide and octave into 12 parts. The result is
a very useful scale that approximates - certainely not all - but 
quite a few of the wonderful intervals discoverable
in the overtone series. An important question is:
How good of an approximation is it? In some cases, quite good!
In others, it may be useful, but it's not particularly accurate. 
Here's a `chromatic scale` - all of the notes in 12-tone equal temperament. You'll hear it in just intonation
(ratio based harmony) and equal temperament at the same time. 
Some of the intervals are essentially the same
while others less accurate.

### Strange Temperament

While I may complain from time to time about the tyranny of 12-tone
equal temperament, equal temperament is a very useful tool. 
WereSoCool allows for composition in any temperament. I often like to
compose in ET(19), ET(31), ET(72), and ET(120).

ET(120) is interesting because it splits every half-step in 
12-tone equal temperament into 10 parts...whoa!
That makes it easy for musicians trained to think in 12-tone 
equal temperament to explore some pretty expressive melodies, 
while still thinking in traditional way. Regardless of you background,
I recommend experimenting with compose melodies in all sorts of equal temperaments.
