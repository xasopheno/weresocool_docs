Having installed the WereSoCool CLI, you can do a lot of cool things:

## Demo

All weird software should have a good demo. If you want to make a cool sound and impress your friends/pets/plants without doing any hard work, you can simply run:

`weresocool demo` 

This is a good way to check that WereSoCool is working correctly on your system. If you don't like the sound it makes, type `ctrl-c` to stop the application. You can always use `ctrl-c` to stop the application.

<Break/>

## New

Now that you've heard a cool sound, you might want to make a cool sound of your own. The easiest way to do this is to run: 

`weresocool new [the_cool_name_of_your_cool_composition]` 

That will create a new `.socool` file using the WereSoCool template. 

<Break/>

## Play

If you want to hear a composition written in WereSoCool, you can run:

`weresocool play [filepath]`

This will play the song one time. 

<Break/>

When you're developing a song, you'll want to use the watch flag:

`weresocool play [filepath] --watch`

This will replay the composition every time the file is saved.

When I'm composing, what I'll usually do is `weresocool play [composition] --watch` the file that I'm working in a terminal side by side with the composition in my editor.

<Break/>

## Print

You can render a `.socool` file to a number of different targets. The default is a `.wav` file. 

`weresocool print [filename]` will render that composition to a wav file. 

You can optionally pass a number of other flags. 
  Usage: weresocool print [OPTIONS] [filename]
  Options:
      --output_dir               [output_dir]
      --wav                      print a wav file (default)
      --mp3                      print an mp3
      --oggvorbis                print an oggvorbis file
      --csv                      print a csv file
      --json                     print a json file
      --stems                    print stems as a zip file
      --sound                    print all sound file types
      --all                      print all file types

<Break/>

## Help

You can always use the help flag when you get stuck. 

For example: `weresocool --help` will print the following:

```
Usage: weresocool [COMMAND]

Commands:
  new    Create a new .socool file from the template
  play   Render a .socool file. Run with --watch to rerend on file save
  demo   Hear a cool sound
  print  Print a .socool composition to a file
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```
