If you had as much fun making cool chords as I do, you'll be happy to know
there's a short-hand for doing just that. 


## `Operation: {Fm, Fa, Gm, Pa}` 
<WereSoCool
  readOnly
  hideGutter
  language={
`-- Each set of four values describes 
-- the frequency multiply, frequency add, 
-- gain multiply, and pan add of a note. 
{Fm, Fa, Gm, Pa}`}
/>
<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
main = {
-- For example: This Overlay describes two notes. 
-- The bottom is the fundamental - 1/1 
-- at gain 1 panned 1/2 the right and 
-- the top is a note an octave above the fundemental 
-- plus 2hz at gain 1 panned 1/2 to the left. 
-- I generally organize notes with the lowest note on the bottom.
  Overlay [
    {2/1, 2, 1, 1/2},
    {1/1, 0, 1, -1/2},
  ]
}`
}/>


Inside of the O[], you can put as many (Fm, Fa, Gm, Pa)'s as you'd like. 
this can be a great way to compose multi-voice chords in a series 
or - as it's used in the song below - to add overtones to other operations.

<WereSoCool language={
`{ f: 261.6, l: 1, g: 1, p: 0 }\n
overtones = {
-- O[(Fm, Fa, Gm, Pa), ...]
  Overlay [
    {3/1, 1, 1/4, -1/4},
    {3/1, 0, 1/4, 1/4},
    {1/1, 2, 1, 1/2},
    {1/1, 0, 1, -1/2},
  ]
}\n
-- This is a little two part song:
melody1 = {
  Seq [
    Fm 1, Fm 9/8, Fm 5/4 | Lm 2, Fm 9/8, Fm 1,
    Fm 3/2 | Lm 4, Fm 5/3, Fm 9/8
  ]
}\n
melody2 = {
  Seq [
    Fm 5/4, Fm 3/2, Fm 5/3 | Lm 2, Fm 3/2, Fm 4/3,
    Fm 9/8 | Lm 3/2, Fm 5/4 | Lm 3/2, Fm 4/3 | Lm 3 
  ]
  | Fm 1/2
}\n
main = {
-- "overtones" contains 4 voices 
-- defined above with O[] syntax.
-- by Piping it into the Overlay 
-- results in the same sound as
-- if we wrote the following:
-- Overlay [
--   overtones | melody1,
--   overtones | melody2
--]
  overtones
  | Overlay [
    melody1,
    melody2,
  ]
--  Then we play the melodies above first at Fm 1
--  (where they would normally play),
--  then play it backwards using Reverse.
  | Seq [
    Fm 1, 
    Reverse
  ]
-- faster
  | Lm 2/5
-- 2x
  | Repeat 2 
-- quieter
  | Gm 1/3
}
